biography: <span class="person">Cameron McLean</span> is a PhD candidate in Computer
  Science at the University of Auckland. Hailing from the biological sciences originally,
  and a keen open science advocate, his current research is exploring the use of design

  to make it easier to capture and share aspects of laboratory practice, and to help
  researchers find, understand, and reuse/reproduce appropriate laboratory methods.
