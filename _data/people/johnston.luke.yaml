biography: <span class="person">Luke Johnston</span> is a PhD student at the Department
  of Nutritional Sciences in the University of Toronto. His research is in diabetes
  epidemiology where he uses data to try to understand how and why some individuals
  develop diabetes and others don't. Teaching proper coding skills and fostering reproducible
  research is something he is very interested in, given that much of science relies
  on the results from these codes and analyses.
