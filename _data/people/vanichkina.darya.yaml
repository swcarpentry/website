name: Darya Vanichkina
biography: <span class="person">Darya Vanichkina</span> is a bioinformatics PhD student
  at the University of Queensland. She is passionate about understanding how the genome
  works to underpin the complexity of the mammalian nervous system, and what goes
  wrong at the molecular level in human neurological disease. Combining her PhD-derived
  bioinformatics knowledge with that obtained via a Specialist Degree in Molecular
  Biology & Biochemistry from Lomonosov Moscow State University, she enjoys initiating
  her (often unsuspecting) students to the magic of data analysis using R, python,
  awk and bash.
