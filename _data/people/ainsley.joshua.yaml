biography: <span class="person">Joshua Ainsley</span> is a Data Scientist at Fino
  Consulting in NYC, where he applies statistical and machine learning approaches
  to projects in the education and energy sectors. Previously, he was a postdoc at
  Tufts University where he performed neuroscience research aimed at better understanding
  learning and memory using high throughput RNA sequencing. As someone who had to
  slowly gain programming skills to understand the large biological data sets generated
  by his research, he is excited to make the process a bit easier for others.
