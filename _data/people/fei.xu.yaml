biography: <span class="person">Xu Fei</span> took a detour to work for the UN in
  New York after completing his MS in neuroscience at McGill University in Canada.
  There he became fascinated by how adults learn new skills. He finally went for the
  SWC instructor training in 2014 and immediately regretted not doing it sooner. Currently
  he is running a startup to test the hypothesis that good data skills would make
  nonprofit organizations more efficient.
