biography: <span class="person">Mike Sumner</span> is a data munger at the Australian
  Antarctic Division, working in partnership with the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems
  CRC and the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania
  in Hobart. He develops and maintains tools to couple ecosystem models with remote
  sensing data and oceanographic model output, sailing the dire straits between scientific
  model data formats and geographic information systems. He loves teaching programming
  skills to new users, especially when map projections are involved and is excited
  by new web technologies to bring interactive exploratory data analysis out in the
  open.
