biography: '[Joshua Madin](acropora.bio.mq.edu.au/people/joshua-madin/) is a quantitative
  ecologist at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. His research focuses on
  marine systems, especially coral reefs, where he uses biophysics, ecological theory
  and informatics to address questions at a range of ecological scales. For example,
  I explore questions spanning from the ecological consequences of tropical cyclones
  to the biogeographical role of functional traits. Joshua, his students and collaborators
  rely heavily on the tools taught by Software Carpentry to address such questions.'
