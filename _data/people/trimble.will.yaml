name: Will Trimble
biography: <span class="person">Will Trimble</span> is a postdoc in the metagenomic
  annotation group at Argonne National Laboratory led by Folker Meyer, the group which
  provides and maintains MG-RAST. He was trained in experimental physics and has moved
  into computational biology, using computers and math to analyze bulky high-throughput
  sequence data. He switched fields out of a desire to participate in inderdisciplinary
  research and teaches Software Carpentry because he regrets using computers so much
  for years without learning the tricks.
