  Text: "My son and I (then 12) were collecting Bugs Life Dominoes which we got free\
    \ at the supermarket when we did the weekly shopping. There were 44 different\
    \ dominoes, but once we had 95 of them it seemed we had an unusually high number\
    \ of some dominoes, for instance we had 9 of domino number 21. \n\nWe were wondering\
    \ if there were equal numbers of each domino made or perhaps whether more were\
    \ made of specific Bugs Life characters, perhaps audience favourites. So we constructed\
    \ a spreadsheet to count frequencies and then wrote some R code to read it in\
    \ and do a Chi square test on our data for the null hypothesis of there being\
    \ equal numbers of each domino made. This gave a p-value of 0.0048 (I just found\
    \ and ran the code again, you never know when old bits of code will be useful\
    \ again), suggesting it was very unlikely, maybe only 1 chance in 208 that there\
    \ were equal numbers of each. So it seems they were making more of favourite characters."

  Text: 'As a way to learn generative artwork creation using python (inspired by inconvergent.net)
    I made a set of scripts to make art! The scripts can render the generation in
    real-time and save the finished work, and the works themselves are based on Brownian
    motion with some other particle interactions thrown in. You can see more on my

  Text: I wrote a script to execute a craigslist search for apartments and then use
    keywords to select the ones I was interested in and email me if a new one appeared
    that matched my criteria. I then set a cronjob to run it every 15 minutes so I
    didn't have to worry about whether or not I was missing something. This enabled
    me to respond to an ad for my current apartment within 15 minutes of its posting.

    This helped indicate when my car may need some sort of service. It also recorded
    a maintainence record which stored when I put oil into my car, had spark plugs
    changed, minor services, major services, etc. '

    commutes are. I continue to use R to visualize the results and run statistical
    tests exploring how departure times affect the length of my commutes.
