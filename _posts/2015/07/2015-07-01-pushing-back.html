  A week ago,
  we posted a proposal to
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/06/using-jekyll-for-lessons.html">use Jekyll to build our lessons</a>
  rather than Pandoc.
  The immediate reaction was almost uniformly positive,
  but in the days since,
  people have pushed back on two fronts:
</p>
<!--more-->
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      We have been changing the way we manage lessons far too often:
      for example,
      one instructor has taught four times since early 2013,
      and the procedure has been different every single time.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We should be putting our energy into writing better lessons,
      not into tweaking our formatting rules and build system.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Both criticisms are valid,
  so after some discussion with our lesson maintainers and the Steering Committee,
  here's what we're going to do:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      We will push back the release date for Version 5.4 of our lessons
      from mid-August to the end of November.
      (The mid-August date was probably always unrealistic...)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We will stick with our existing build system for Version 5.4,
      i.e.,
      there will be no changes in tooling until the end of November.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We will focus our energy between now and then on revising our lessons.
      In particular,
      we will convert our Python lesson to Python 3
      and figure out how to act on
      <a href="{{site.github_url}}/python-novice-inflammation/issues/127">this discussion about its future</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This decision is another reflection of the fact that Software Carpentry is a community project:
  the volunteers who create its lessons, teach them, and sit on the Steering Committee
  are the ones who decide what happens next.
  The process might have some rough edges,
  but I think the result is something we can be proud of.
