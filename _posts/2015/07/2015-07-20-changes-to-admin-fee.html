<p>
  After discussion with our Advisory Council and Data Carpentry, we
  have agreed to make some changes to the administration fee we charge
  for workshops that we help organize in order to reflect the real
  cost of our staff's time and our overheads, and to reflect the value
  of the training.  Please see
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/request/">the workshop request page</a>
  for the updated pricing information.

<p>
  These rules keep us in step with Data Carpentry,
  which <a href="http://datacarpentry.github.io/blog/2015/07/20/workshop-fees/">recently
  decided</a> to make similar changes in their administrative fees.
  The only significant differences is that Data Carpentry doesn't yet
  have a partnership or affiliation scheme, so there are no discounts
  for DC workshops.
</p>
<p>
  The new administrative fees will apply to workshops requested after
  September 1, 2015.  (Note that the transition is based on when the
  workshop request is received, not when the workshop takes place.)
  As per our current policy, if a not-for-profit organization such as
  a university or government institution has already paid $1250 for a
  workshop this year, we will only charge $750 per workshop for their
  subsequent workshops until December 31st.  If you have any
  questions, please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">get in touch</a>.
