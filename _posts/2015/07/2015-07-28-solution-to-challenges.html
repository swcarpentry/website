  One of the enhancement that we have in mind for the next release of our lessons
  is to provide the solution for the challenges.
  Having the solutions will help instructors speed up when preparing the lesson
  for workshops and learners reading the lessons.
  Before we start adding the solutions will be great to have one template
  for how it should be write.
  If you have some suggestions,
  please add it at <a href="{{site.github_url}}/lesson-template/issues/267">this issue on GitHub</a>.
