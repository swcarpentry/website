  We are very pleased to announce that Maneesha Sane (pronounced
  "sah-nay") will be joining us in August as our new Program
  Coordinator.  Having coordinated and managed public events and
  mentoring programs for several organizations in the Philadelphia
  area, Maneesha retrained as a software developer.  She has been
  managing events and matching mentors to learners for over a decade,
  and we are looking forward to working with her.

  We would also like to welcome Katarzyna Zaczek, who works for our
  Polish partner Cyfronet.  Katarzyna will help to coordinate
  workshops in continental Europe, just as the SSI's Giacomo Peru has
  been handling those in the UK.  Together, they will enable us to
  cope with the ever-increasing demand for Software Carpentry
  training: we have run 195 workshops at 136 institutions and gained
  285 new instructors, in the past 12 months, and those numbers are
  only going to increase.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, we must also say goodbye (again) to Amy Brown, who
  will be stepping down in a few weeks once Maneesha is up to speed.
  She contributed significantly to get us to where we are now, and we
  are very grateful for everything she and Arliss Collins have done
  for us in their time with Software Carpentry.
</p>

  This also marks the end of our formal relationship with the Mozilla
  Science Lab.  In the year since Software Carpentry re-established
  itself as an independent organization, it has become clear that we
  and MSL are focused on helping scientists in different ways.  We
  will of course continue to work alongside MSL as we do with other
  advocates for better and more open science, and wish them the best
  with their projects.
