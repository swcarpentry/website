  We are pleased to announce that
  <a href="http://camillescott.github.io/2015-08-16-ucdavis-wise/">the latest in our series of workshops for women in science and engineering</a>
  will be held at UC Davis on August 17-18, 2015.
   This workshop is aimed at those in science, engineering, medicine, or related fields
  who identify as women, female, or on the non-binary spectrum.
  Our instructors are experienced with creating safe spaces for those on the trans* spectrum,
  and one openly identifies as a trans woman;
  ensuring that we maintain an inclusive environment is a top priority for this workshop.
  For more information, or to register,
  please see <a href="http://camillescott.github.io/2015-08-16-ucdavis-wise/">the workshop website</a>.
