<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>
We're excited to announce the official release of
<a href="http://physics.codes">"Effective Computation In Physics"</a>.
This book was written by two Software Carpentry
instructors, <a href="http://anthony.scopatz.com">Anthony Scopatz</a>
and <a href="https://katyhuff.github.io">myself, Katy Huff</a>. We
were enormously inspired by the vision and work of the Software
Carpentry community and expanded on that vision in the book to create
a "field guide to research in Python." While examples and more
advanced content are presented in the context of research in the
physical sciences, the majority of the book will be useful to all
researchers doing scientific computation.  In book form, we were able
to dive in and expand on best practices more deeply and more
extensively than is possible in a workshop. We're extremely proud to
have created "SWC in a book"

<h2>What's On It?</h2>
<p>The creature on the cover is the adorable and fascinating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobtail_squid">Bobtail Squid</a>.</p>

<br/>
<p>
In addition to being adorned by the bobtail squid, the book is emblazoned with
the kind words of two of our mentors. First and foremost, upon handling the book, the
reader will encounter a quotation from Fernando Perez on the back cover.
Additionally, the first few pages contain a foreword by Greg Wilson.
<b>Anthony and I are humbled and proud to have the kind support of
these two extraordinary individuals, without whom this book could not
have existed.</b> To read what they said, you'll have to get your
hands on a book.  All I'll say here is that both were kinder than we
could have dreamed.
</p>
<h2>What's In It?</h2>
<p>Since different scientists struggle in different ways at each stage of the
research game, we wanted to cover the whole playbook of scientific computing
best practices. Thus, we formed this book around the idea of a soup-to-nuts,
idea-to-publication scientific research workflow, split into four
parts:
<ul>
<li>Getting Started</li>
<li>Getting It Done</li>
<li>Getting It Right</li>
<li>Getting It Out There</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
Software Carpentry instructors, students, and community members will recognize
the motivation to introduce basic features of the bash shell and Python before
diving in. That's exactly what we do in this book as well, preparing the reader
for some computational thinking using plenty of examples and exercises.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1 - Introduction to the Command Line</li>
<li>Chapter 2 - Programming Blast Off with Python</li>
<li>Chapter 3 - Essential Containers</li>
<li>Chapter 4 - Flow Control and Logic</li>
<li>Chapter 5 - Operating with Functions</li>
<li>Chapter 6 - Classes and Objects</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting it Done</h3>
<p>
Equipped with the basic concepts, the reader is now ready to build the software. This part focuses on
the details of handling and analyzing data, key data structures, data storage,
parallelization, and package deployment. We think of these skills as core to
the generation of software in the physical sciences, so readers from other
scientific disciplines may not find this part of the book as relevant to their
work as the other parts.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 7 - Analysis and Visualization</li>
<li>Chapter 8 - Regular Expressions</li>
<li>Chapter 9 - NumPy: Thinking in Arrays</li>
<li>Chapter 10 - Storing Data: Files and HDF5</li>
<li>Chapter 11 - Important Data Structures in Physics</li>
<li>Chapter 12 - Performing in Parallel</li>
<li>Chapter 13 - Deploying Software</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting It Right</h3>
<p>In this part of the book, notions of reproducibility and defensive
programming reign. These chapters make the case and provide a foundation for
producing automated, version controlled, verified, and validated software.
<ul>
<li>Chapter 14 - Building Software Pipelines</li>
<li>Chapter 15 - Local Version Control</li>
<li>Chapter 16 - Remote Version Control</li>
<li>Chapter 17 - Debugging</li>
<li>Chapter 18 - Testing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting It Out There</h3>
<p>
Of course, <b>science unshared is not science.</b> Thus, we share tools for automating
documentation and publication and have chapters focused on the people-related
issues encountered in collaborative, open-source work.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 19 - Documentation</li>
<li>Chapter 20 - Publication</li>
<li>Chapter 21 - Collaboration</li>
<li>Chapter 22 - Licenses, Ownership, and Copyright</li>
<li>Chapter 23 - Further Musings on Computational Physics</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where To Get It</h2>
<p>
The book can be acquired in many ways. Through Safari Books Online,
O'Reilly books
are <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/connected/">free for
K-12 students</a>.  But, don't worry - even if high school is long
past, you can still get a discount until July
17th <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033424.do?code=WKPYDP">
using the discount code: WKPYDP </a> on the O'Reilly website. The book
can also be found
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Computation-Physics-Anthony-Scopatz/dp/1491901535">on Amazon</a>
and in many other places where books are lent or sold. We
hope you enjoy it and that you'll post a review or tweet
