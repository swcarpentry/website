  We had a great birds of a feather session at the SciPy conference last week
  and decided to create a mailing list specifically for
  instructors who are interested in using the Jupyter Notebook for teaching.
  The aim of the mailing list is to provide a place for instructors to share materials, strategies, advice, etc.
  on teaching with the notebook and the logistics that are involved with that.
  If you're interested in joining the mailing list as well,
  you can add yourself at
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter-education">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter-education</a>

  We look forward to chatting with you there.
