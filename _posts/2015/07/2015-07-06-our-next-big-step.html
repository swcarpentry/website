<p>
  With Software Carpentry's rapid growth over the past couple of years,
  the combined responsibilities of being the Executive Directory and running the instructor training program
  have become more than a single person can manage.
  And after five years of working to grow Software Carpentry into the world-wide community it has become,
  I'd like to spend more time with my family.
</p>
<p>
  The Software Carpentry Foundation is therefore
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/07/new-executive-director-search.html">hiring a new Executive Director</a>.
  I will transition to running instructor training
  so that the new ED can devote themselves to building relations with partners,
  overseeing the development of our curriculum,
  being Software Carpentry's spokesperson,
  and working with the Steering Committee to set our future direction.
  Our new hire will initially be co-Executive Director,
  and will job-share with me during a brief transition period,
  after which they will become the new ED.
</p>
<p>
  This is the next logical step in Software Carpentry's evolution,
  and one that we have been working toward for more than a year.
  As with the election of the Steering Committee in January,
  it's a sign that Software Carpentry is here to stay,
  and nothing could make me prouder.

<h2>Mechanics</h2>
<p>
  The timing of the transition will be negotiated with the successful applicant.
  Whatever is decided,
  I will start working part-time as soon as they are hired,
  and will step down as soon as the Steering Committee feels the new ED is ready,
  but no later than the end of December 2015.
</p>
<p>
  Pay will also be negotiated,
  and will be very competitive with equivalent academic and industrial positions and commensurate with experience.
  There is no fixed geographic requirement for this job&mdash;it can be done anywhere with reliable Internet access&mdash;but
  it will require some travel (about half a dozen trips per year).
