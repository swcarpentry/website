  This is wonderful news:
  the Helmsley Charitable Trust, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
  have <a href="https://www.moore.org/newsroom/press-releases/2015/07/07/$6m-for-uc-berkeley-and-cal-poly-to-expand-and-enhance-open-source-software-for-scientific-computing-and-data-science">just pledged $6M over three years to Project Jupyter</a>
  (formerly known as the IPython Notebook).
  Fernando Perez of University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
  and Brian Granger of California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo will lead the project.
  Congratulations to them, their team, and their community&mdash;this is well deserved,
  and will help scientists all over the world in ways we cannot yet even imagine.
