  The Fellowship Programme run by
  the <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">Software Sustainability
  Institute</a> funds researchers in exchange for their expertise and
  advice. The main goals of the Programme are encouraging best
  practice and gathering information about research software from all
  disciplines, and encouraging Fellows to develop their interests in
  the area of software sustainability (especially in their areas of
  work).  The Programme also supports capacity building and policy
  development initiatives.

<p>
  Each Fellow is allocated &pound;3,000 to spend over fifteen
  months. The funding is flexible to support activities that are
  beneficial to both the Fellows and the Institute: for instance, to
  fund travel to conferences, to setup and run workshops, to organise
  software sustainability sessions at domain conferences, or to host,
  organise or teach at <a href="{{site.baseurl}}">Software Carpentry</a>
  or similar training events.
</p>
<p>
  Fellows are drawn from a wide range of areas, experience, and career
  stages:
