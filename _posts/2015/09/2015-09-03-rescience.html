<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>It's our great pleasure to announce the creation of "ReScience" which is
a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and
encourages the explicit replication of already published research,
promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that
the original research is reproducible.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To achieve such a goal, the whole editing chain is radically different
from any other traditional scientific journal. ReScience lives on GitHub
where each new implementation is made available together with comments,
explanations and tests. Each submission takes the form of a pull request
that is publicly reviewed and tested in order to guarantee that any
researcher can re-use it.</p>
<p>Students are strongly encourage to submit to ReScience. Even if the
publishing model is a bit different from other academic journals, this
will give them a first experience at peer-reviewed publishing where you
have to use a rigorous and scientific approach.</p>
