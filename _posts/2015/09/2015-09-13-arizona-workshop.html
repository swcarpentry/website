<p>As computing skills are becoming increasingly important and essential for researchers, the Software Carpentry Foundation has been playing a major role in professional development in practical and technical computing. Since 1998 volunteers from Software Carpentry have been teaching researchers in science, engineering, medicine, and related disciplines the essential computing skills they need to get more done in less time, and with less pain. </p>
<p>The iPlant Collaborative, the Arizona Environmental Grid Infrastructure Service (AEGIS), and the BIO5 Institute are proud to present the second Software Carpentry Workshop on the UA campus.  The workshop targets graduate students, postdocs, technicians, and faculty; undergraduate students can be admitted if space is available. It covers the foundational skills  necessary to be productive in a small research teams, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Scripting your analyses with R (make your analyses reproducible and repeatable)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Efficient use of the Unix shell (how to automate repetitive tasks)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Git and GitHub (how to track and share work efficiently)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to use all of these skills in the context of iPlant's powerful cloud computing infrastructure</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Workshop participation is free; refreshments will be provided.</p>
