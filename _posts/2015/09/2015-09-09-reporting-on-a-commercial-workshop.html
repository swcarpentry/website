  On August 22, Marty McGuire
  (<a href="https://twitter.com/schmarty">@schmarty</a>) and I
  (<a href="https://twitter.com/joshua_r_smith">@joshua_r_smith</a>)
  taught a
  <a href="https://shirtable.github.io/2015-08-22-baltimore/">for-profit workshop</a>
  based on Software Carpentry materials,
  particularly the
  <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/python-novice-inflammation/">novice Python lesson</a>.
  This post is a debrief of that workshop.

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
  We forked
  the <a href="{{site.github_url}}/workshop-template">workshop-template</a>
  and
  the <a href="{{site.github_url}}/python-novice-inflammation">python-novice-inflammation</a>
  repos to build a workshop website and notes for the Python
  lesson. We decided to only do a one-day class because we did no
  marketing in the sense that we did not target any specific group for
  this workshop. For typical Software Carpentry workshops, part of the
  marketing is already done: SWC generally does workshops for some
  subset of science people.
</p>
<p>
  We also charged $20 US per person for the workshop; this fee was to
  mitigate no-shows. (The fee was collected via Eventbrite.)  The goal
  of this workshop wasn't to make money, it was to go through the
  process once and figure out where the bugs are.  We coordinated over
  the phone and via the issue tracker on a private GitHub repo we set
  up.
</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>
  All of the attendees were highly impressed by the quality of the
  Software Carpentry material. Many of them found it via the
  attribution link we put on our site according to SWC's attribution
  rules.
</p>
<p>
  We were very grateful for the level of detail with regards to set up
  instructions,
  e.g. the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/">operations guide</a>.
  and checklists.
  It is clear that these documents were created at the cost of many
  mistakes made by prior instructors.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the liberal Creative Commons license of the SWC materials
  was really the enabling feature for this workshop. We are very
  grateful for all of the hard work SWC volunteers have donated to
  making this material excellent.
</p>
<h2>The "Could Be Better"</h2>
<p>
  Two major things stand out, which are related.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      It was more difficult than it should have been to re-brand the
      lesson materials to comply with SWC's copyright disclaimer:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	All of our lessons are freely available under the Creative
	Commons - Attribution License.  You may re-use and re-mix the
	material in any way you wish, without asking permission,
	provided you cite us as the original source (e.g., provide a
	link back to this website).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Having both the Markdown source and the HTML built from it in
      the same repo, in the same branch was non-optimal. This setup
      makes sense based on the varying levels of Git mastery of the
      contributors especially regarding contributors' familiarity with
      Git's branching and merging model. Nevertheless, it felt like it
      was counter to version control best practice.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  These two issues could likely be mitigated by switching to a static
  site generator (such as Jekyll) to build the HTML pages from some
  Markdown source. Clearly, the Shirtable
  team <a href="{{site.github_url}}/lesson-template/issues/279">aren't
  the first to have this idea</a>. Once the transition to Jekyll has
  been made, the actual lesson material can live in Markdown files and
  whatever assets are required by the lesson (data files, images,
  Jupyter Notebooks, etc.). The branding could even be stored in a
  separate repo that's brought into the lesson repo as a
  submodule. I'm pretty sure that's
  how <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/themes.html">Pelican
  does it</a>. It seems like all of these details could be handled by
  a build script.
</p>
<p>
  Solving this issue is important, and not just to help for-profit
  entities like Shirtable. Anyone, even not-for-profits and educators,
  will need to re-brand these materials in order to comply with the
  rules. The Shirtable team believes the difficulty associated with
  rebranding is a higher barrier than necessary for educators with
  limited temporal resources to wrangle the source.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  All in all, we accomplished the objective we set out to
  accomplish. The workshop instructors and participants all found the
  SWC Python material to be valuable, informative, and
  easy-to-follow.
