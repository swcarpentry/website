  "Teaching to the test" has a deservedly bad reputation,
  but what about "teaching to the workflow"?
  A group of us came together at the
  <a href="http://nceas.github.io/open-science-codefest/">NCEAS Open Science Codefest</a>
  last year and put together
  <a href="http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/ES14-00402.1">a paper on open science in ecology</a>.
  In it,
  we sketch three examples of possible open science workflows
  (Figure 2 in the paper).
  In response,
  I was asked what Software Carpentry should teach
  to prepare people for working in those ways.
  My top three things are (in order):

      The idea that it's OK to be wrong in public. As long as people
      are honest about what they're trying to do and what they think
      what they've done means. And they try to make it right when they
      are wrong. And that everyone is wrong sometimes. And that a lot
      of people are willing to help fix honest mistakes or
      misunderstandings (see, e.g.,
      <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>). And
      that this, it seems to me, is how science
      overall <em>should</em> (and sometimes does) work. We're all in
      this together. This is why I think it's so important for
      instructors to screw up when teaching and <em>slowly</em> talk
      through how they untangle themselves. No grad student or
      programmer starts out like Athena from the head of Zeus, fully
      formed and brilliant from the beginning. Because writing,
      documenting, and openly sharing scientific thinking and the code
      behind it&mdash;even with mistakes&mdash;is one of the best ways
      we have as scientists to be honest with ourselves and with
      others.

      The idea of provenance. Not just in the formal sense but also in
      the broader sense, related to a whole ton of important ideas,
      including but not limited to: metadata, version control, code
      modularity, Don't Repeat Yourself, testing, open access,
      etc. Science is deeply and fundamentally about provenance of
      ideas and provenance of evidence. All scientists get this
      intuitively, but the ways to document this trail are changing
      and multiplying rapidly. Where is the idea from (articles, DOIs,
      open access)? What is the evidence for it (figures, tables,
      statistics)? How were the analyses done (code, version control,
      formal computational provenance)? Where did the data come from
      (metadata, data archiving, well-documented field or lab
      methods)? Software Carpentry has for a long time taught people
      how to structure and document code and make analyses
      reproducible, but I think a lot of people (myself included) also
      want and need to learn how to better structure, from start to
      finish, their project organizational schemes and filesystems
      (and their science!) with provenance in mind. Because the
      process of science is messy, it's not and will never be
      easy. But it seems to me that many of us want to know how to do
      it better.

      The idea of structured data. This could be anything from how to
      use Excel responsibly, to munging/slicing/dicing in python/R, to
      designing bespoke SQLite databases, but the <em>idea</em> of it
      is crucial. This is very rarely taught in any formal setting and
      absolutely is the key enabling anything analytical that
      follows. Most people, in my experience, struggle through until
      they, by chance, hit upon the format that enables pivot
      tables/JMP/ggplot to work well. Structuring data well from the
      start leads to easier and less frustrating analyses, easier and
      less frustrating collaborations, and easier and less frustrating
      archiving. In the end, science and scientists win when data are
      well-structured. Format code for people and format data for
      machines.

  What would <em>you</em> teach to prepare people to do the best
  science possible given the changing technological landscape?
