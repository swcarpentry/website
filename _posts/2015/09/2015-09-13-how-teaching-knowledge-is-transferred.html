  Being back in Edinburgh thirty years on
  has occasioned much reflection upon lessons learned.
  This has occasioned a re-reading of some papers by
  Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/saf/">Sally Fincher</a>,
  whose <a href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/research/groups/compedu/">research group</a>
  at the University of Kent
  studies the teaching and learning of computer science.
  In particular,
  I have been looking at what they have discovered about
  how educators share teaching practices.
  I hope these excerpts and reflections are of interest.

<h2><a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/jtenenbg/publications/fincherWarrensQuestion-icer2007.pdf">Warren's Question</a></h2>
<p>
  This paper is a close look at a request for help that one instructor posted to a forum
  and what happened next.
  The conclusion is that top-down dissemination rarely if ever works.
  Instead,
  instructors borrow bits and pieces that they happen to stumble upon
  when and as they need them:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    It is <strong>not a common practice</strong> among tertiary
    educators <strong>to observe teaching in someone else's
    institution</strong>. Although peer observation is becoming more
    common within departments (sometimes within institutions) it is
    essentially unheard of between institutions. And when the
    motivations for peer observation are examined, this is not
    surprising. They are, in general, linked to the quality assurance
    and staff development of the observed teacher. From that
    perspective there is simply no point in observing practice to
    ensure the quality of teaching in some other institution, nor any
    incentive to develop their staff.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Unexpectedly, whether because observers were observing outside
    their home institutions, or whether because they were highly
    sensitised to the curriculum and material being delivered,
    <strong>observers were especially struck by aspects of context
    that are normally invisible</strong>. These observations included
    the physical setting of the university, the material and
    technological objects within the classroom, the student
    interactions with one another. The shared disciplinary background
    meant that, for the observer, the observation began not when
    entering the classroom, but when leaving their own.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>The normal mechanisms employed for transfer of ideas in
    teaching and learning are in the mode of disseminator
    push</strong>: that is that something is identified (a teaching
    method, a "best practice", a theory) and it is packaged and
    promoted to interested parties by a staff developer or a
    researcher, via mechanisms such as papers, books, websites and
    workshops. This is the trajectory that is often assumed for
    educational research&mdash;that "dissemination" to practitioners
    occurs simply by virtue of publication in a research
    venue. However, <strong>evidence from empirical studies suggests
    that transfer of practice and knowledge to practitioners is rarely
    occasioned by these research-to-practice, top-down
    methods</strong>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>Teachers change their practices, adopting (transferring)
    ideas and materials from direct, personal contact with other
    practitioners as and when they need</strong>&mdash;often in very
    small, partial, pieces ("piecemeal accretion") or by virtue of
    having experienced it in another institution and, with a change of
    employment, importing it to a new context ("charismatic
    embedding"). Thus these <strong>transfers are achieved directly
    from practitioner to practitioner, from one specific setting to
    another, mediated neither by theory, researcher, or staff
    developer.</strong>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Survey results...support the conjecture that knowledge transfer
    rarely happens top-down, from researcher to practitioner. When
    asked "What published material do you read with regard to your
    teaching?", seven participants mention reading technical
    publications related to disciplinary knowledge, five mention
    textbooks, five mention CS Ed practitioner conference
    proceedings... Only one... (a CS Ed researcher) ...mentioned
    reading the CS Education research literature; and none mentioned
    reading research in the learning sciences, in the behavioural or
    social sciences, or disciplinary education research in cognate
    disciplines...
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The inefficiency of "pull transfer" is its most obvious drawback,
  but in addition, its ad hoc nature makes even its practitioners
  downplay it, which in turn means that people aren't given full
  credit for their ideas:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    [C]'s acknowledgement of this cycle of adoption and adaptation
    comes with the slightly shamefaced 'there's nothing like
    plagiarism, eh?' This...symbolises one of the fundamental features
    that differentiate the activities of teaching and
    research. <strong>'Plagiarism' is about public attribution of the
    source of ideas, a basic requirement of research-based activity
    but one that is more-or-less unknown in teaching.</strong> It
    suggests that it is not important&mdash;to [C], to the colleagues
    within his institution, or to his disciplinary peers&mdash;to
    acknowledge sources of teaching knowledge in the same way as in
    research. This would also imply that <strong>there is no incentive
    or reward for giving such acknowledgement, and that there are no
    evolved norms that require it. Part of the reason for this is that
    teaching practice is often ephemeral, enacted but not
    documented. And those parts of teaching that are documented are
    rarely referenced with sources as would be ordinary in the
    documentation of research. As a result, provenance is easily lost
    in teaching practice.</strong>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    This loss of provenance in teaching, this rootlessness and
    reinvention of practice, paradoxically places <em>more</em>
    emphasis on practitioner-to-practitioner transfer, unmediated by
    documentary evidence.

<p>
  This paper's abstract is a better summary than I could possibly write:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Innovative tools and teaching practices often fail to be adopted
    by educators in the field, despite evidence of their
    effectiveness. Na&iuml;ve models of educational change assume this
    lack of adoption arises from failure to properly disseminate
    promising work, but <strong>evidence suggests that dissemination
    via publication is simply not effective</strong>. Instead of
    studying the adoption or rejection of a particular intervention,
    this paper turns the problem around. <strong>We asked educators to
    describe changes they had made to their teaching practice and
    analyzed the resulting stories</strong> to learn more about: the
    kinds of changes being made, their motivations for changing their
    practice, and the means by which they learned of pedagogical
    innovations. <strong>Of the 99 change stories analyzed, only three
    demonstrate an active search for new practices or materials on the
    part of teachers, and published materials were consulted in just
    eight of the stories. Most of the changes occurred locally,
    without input from outside sources, or involved only personal
    interaction with other educators.</strong>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  A few quotes from the paper:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    ...there is little evidence that enhanced efforts at dissemination
    are working. A report to the National Research Council in 2008
    found that "NSF- and association-funded reforms at the classroom
    level, however well intentioned, have not led to the hoped for
    magnitude of change in student learning, retention in the major,
    and the like in spite of empirical evidence of
    effectiveness". Failure to adopt effective practices is not
    limited to computing or education. A meta-analysis of 743 reports,
    books, and articles in 2005 found that dissemination alone was not
    an effective implementation method in human services, education,
    health, business, or manufacturing.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    ...there were notable differences in response dependent on how
    long the contributor had been teaching, and on the time a
    contributor had been at their current institution. In both cases
    the longer the time, the more the response moved from the change
    affecting individual practice only towards affecting other
    colleagues and then programmatic change.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The most populated catalyst category [i.e., explanation of reason
    for change] was of educators initiating change in response to
    students: in response to something they did, or something they
    said, or to a close observation of their attitudes and
    achievements.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    ...a least populated category was 'external imposition'...
  </p>
<p>
  In just over half of the stories...the instructor apparently
  formulated the details of their pedagogical change on their own,
  without consulting peers or other resources... This...is perhaps not
  surprising given that 'change in response to students' was...the
  most common catalyst category.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    ...[some] stories described changes resulting from chance
    encounters with educators who shared or demonstrated details of
    their teaching practice. The authors of these stories had not
    intended to change their practice until they were exposed to a new
    approach.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    A larger group of change stories...involved <em>primed
    serendipity</em>, where <strong>the author encountered
    unanticipated information but while putting themselves in
    situations where they could reasonably expect to
    learn <em>something</em> about teaching practices</strong>
    (e.g. attending a conference or workshop, or browsing a journal
    issue)...Over 90% of the stories described changes that were
    either created without drawing on outside sources, or were
    informed by personal interactions with other educators.

<h2><a href="http://ims.mii.lt/ims/konferenciju_medziaga/ICER'10/docs/p107.pdf">Repositories of Teaching Material and Communities of Use: Nifty Assignments and the Greenroom</a></h2>
<p>
  The key challenges in building a lesson repository are:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Curation: "Although it is easy to start a collection, it is often
    more difficult to maintain it."
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Software Carpentry instructors must do this once to qualify.  We
      have maintainers, but our contribution curve definitely has a
      long-tail distribution.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Content: "The focus of content, aimed broadly at a discipline or
    narrowly at a specific area, seems to have a significant impact on
    the severity of the challenges in all other aspects. The broader
    the focus, the harder other aspects become."
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      We are one course with only a handful of modules, so our focus
      is pretty narrow by the paper's measure.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Contribution: Quoting a personal communication from the author of
    another survey, "In the surveys we have done, we find a
    contradictory set of opinions: professors want resources to use,
    but they are not willing to share back the modifications they make
    to these resources. And the effort it takes to get a resource
    published is often ignored, so most people just don't do anything
    to publish things on the web in a way that it is truly
    useful."
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This is not as much a problem for us: we're mostly curating.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Community: "In other community driven endeavours, such as open
    source software communities, reward is often received through peer
    recognition from fellow community members. In many online teaching
    repositories, community recognition is low or absent."
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Our community is defined as "people who use our lessons", which
      helps with recognition.  That said, we should probably add all
      the contributors' names to each lesson's home page...
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Catalog: "Once materials are gathered together, there has to be a
    way for users to locate the item that is most useful to them for
    their current need, or allow them to search for it easily."
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      We only have a small number of modules, so it's easy to find
      what you want&mdash;once you've found the site, of course.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Control: "All repositories grapple with issues of control: who can
    contribute, who admits the contribution, and how the quality of
    contributed material is assured."
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      We borrow rules and conventions from open source, which most of
      our contributors accept as given, and don't try to control who
      uses materials.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
  As a side note, it's interesting to contrast Software Carpentry with
  the <a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/">Nifty Assignments</a>
  repository: new material is only added to Nifty Assignments once a
  year, and entry is competitive (i.e., it's not enough to be good:
  you have to be better than other assignments put forward in that
  year).  Neither choice seems likely to build a culture of
  contribution or increase the average would-be contributor's
  confidence in her/his ability.
</p>
<p>
  Later,
  quoting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Project-Work-Principles/dp/185233357X">earlier
  work</a>, the authors say that "borrowing provokes invention", so
  that "using a software library" is the wrong model for using a
  lesson, because (almost) everyone adapts to a different audience, a
  different precursor, or a different personal style of teaching.
  However, no alternative metaphor given: if sharing lessons isn't
  like using a library, what <em>is</em> it like?
</p>
<p>
  Later still,
  "There was little distaste&mdash;indeed, some enthusiasm&mdash;for the re-use of pedagogic materials."
  That's hardly a ringing endorsement...
</p>
<p>
  Finally,
  the paper teases out some implications:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      ...the users of the Nifty repository do not appear to want
      library-type resources. They do not feel the need for
      catalogues, they are content with the current methods of
      searching, but would like the metadata associated with each
      resources extended...
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      ...they are not looking for a one-stop-shop with a comprehensive
      set of resources and the heavyweight 'authority' of editorial
      constraints... Nor are they especially interested in the
      comprehensiveness of the content of the resources as they
      recognise that they will have to adapt anything to local
      context.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      They would seem to value curators above librarians.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
