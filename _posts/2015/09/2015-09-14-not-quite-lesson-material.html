  Lesson plans are a funny thing.
  The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/lessons/">Software
  Carpentry lessons</a> are an odd balance of a lesson to be read
  (like a textbook) and a lesson plan for instructors, where they
  bring the text to life via speaking, live coding, and doing
  exercises.
</p>
<p>
  This text format doesn't lend itself well to a few activities I've used
  in Software Carpentry workshops.  So I'm going to throw them up here
  for other instructors to look at - feel free to add your own activities
  in the comments, or submit another blog post!

<h2>Git Demo</h2>
<p>
  Before teaching
  the <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/git-novice">Git novice</a>
  lesson, I have done the following live demo.  All that's needed is a
  picture taking device, preferably a smartphone or tablet.  I've
  never timed it, but I don't think it takes very long - probably
  around 5 minutes.
</p>
<p>
  I do this <em>after</em> configuring git, but before the
  first <code>git init</code>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The scenario: the workshop room is directory, each student is a file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Have all students write down some datum on their green sticky
      note (I've used number of years in higher ed, could be
      anything).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Explain that you want to track this data.  To do so, you'll be
      creating a recording device (hold up the smartphone or tablet)
      and taking a picture. Before you can take a picture, you'll need
      everybody to stand up so they can be in the picture
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Have everyone stand (holding up their sticky with a piece of
      data), and take a picture with your device.  Have everyone sit
      down.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now the data is going to change.  Have everyone write down
      another datum (you choose), on their other sticky note.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Explain that this time, you want to save the changes in two
      batches.  Have half the room rise, with both stickies, take a
      photo.  Do the other half of the room.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Optional: point out that you didn't want that last piece of data
      after all.  So hold up the device with the first photo and say
      "return to this".  Everyone should leave their second sticky on
      the table.  Have everyone rise with just the first sticky
      (again) and take another photo.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  To wrap up, explain that everyone has just experienced a typical git
  workflow...
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Create a recording device, also known as a repository (the
      smartphone/tablet)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Stage data files (standing up)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Commit those changes (take a picture)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Repeat the process, with the ability to stage and commit groups
      of files (half and half)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  ...and that you'll now be covering the commands used in the shell to
  achieve the same thing.
</p>
<p>
  Later in the lesson, when talking about commit hashes, I use this
  example again to explain that Git auto-generates a hash, just like
  your camera-device gives an automatic name to photos, but you can
  refer to commits in an ordered way as well, just as you scroll
  through photos on your device in chronological order.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to go really crazy, the contrast of sticky notes in the
  photo can be a parallel to using <code>git diff</code> and the
  return to an original state as an example of
  <code>git checkout ####</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Pedagogical disclaimer: the motivation for this demo is purely to
  get people standing up, moving, and physically interacting with
  these ideas, which are otherwise very abstract.  Personally, I have
  always found that I remember exactly the bits of lessons where I had
  to stand up and <em>do</em> something.  So I have no research-based
  reason to use this demo except my own experience.  That and students
  seem to like it.  If anyone can provide evidence to support me,
  that'd be great!
</p>
<h2>Shell group activity</h2>
<p>
  There's a fine line in the shell lesson between "teaching shell
  commands", "teaching shell concepts", and "teaching general
  programming constructs by using the shell."  Life is challenging.
</p>
<p>
  One thing I do to address this balance is break up the shell lesson
  into two pieces.  The first piece is "shell concepts" (the idea of
  the filesystem, and being able to run any command from anywhere) and
  the second piece is "general programming constructs" (scripts,
  loops, pipes and filters).  To bridge the two, I take a little break
  and have people investigate shell commands themselves.  The logical
  link for me is: we've learned about some very basic shell commands and
  how the shell works generally; now let's do a (brief!) overview of
  some of the variety of shell commands; then we can talk about how
  good practices like loops, scripts, pipes will allow us to use this
  variety of commands in <em>even more</em> ways.
</p>
<p>
  The activity is very simple - I divide the room into groups and give
  each of them a shell command to research.  A sample list might be:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>less</code> vs <code>cat</code>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>grep</code>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>wc</code>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>sort</code>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>uniq</code>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>find</code>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>cut</code>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each group needs to use the <code>man</code> pages (or the internet)
  to find out what the command does, think of an example for the
  instructor (me) to demonstrate, and describe a scenario where that
  command might be useful.  After a few minutes working together, each
  group "presents" to the large group, facilitated by the instructor.
  I'm always careful to point out that this is purely a <em>brief</em>
  summary, and that I'm trying to expose them to the range of shell
  commands and to give them the skills to pursue whatever they might
  need later on their own.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Things I like about this activity: it provides a natural break
      from the instructor talking, works well for both novice and
      advanced learners (advanced learners can move onto other
      commands if they finish theirs, or help their group members),
      and helps illustrate what the shell can do without explicitly
      covering any one thing in detail.  Also, not much prep!  :)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Things I don't like about this activity: It could be information
      overload?  I could see it being overwhelming for a true novice.
      Or that people would check out if they are very novice or very
      advanced.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Shell demo</h2>
<p>
  I haven't done this yet, because I haven't taught the shell lesson
  since I thought of it.  But I'd like to try to the following to
  really drive home the idea of relative and absolute paths and that
  shell commands are run <em>relative to the working directory</em>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use the same idea as the git demo, that rooms are directories
      and people are files.  In that context, <code>ls</code> is like
      saying "tell me the name of everyone in the room."
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Step outside the room briefly.  Come back in and ask, what
      response would I get if I asked that question outside
      (running <code>ls</code> in a different directory)?  What if I
      asked that question outside, but I specified the workshop room
      (using <code>ls</code> with a relative path)?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Back in the workshop room, how would I ask the names of people
      in a different room in the building?  Would need either a
      relative path (go out the door, down the stairs, turn left,
      etc.) or an absolute path (Milky Way -&gt; Solar System -&gt;
      Earth -&gt; Continent -&gt; etc.) to know where to go to ask the
      question.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Reiterate the ideas above on the command line, drawing clear
      parallels between the rooms/directories and how to
      use <code>ls</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It makes sense to me, but I'm not sure if it would clarify ideas or
  confuse the listeners.  Thoughts are welcomed!
</p>
