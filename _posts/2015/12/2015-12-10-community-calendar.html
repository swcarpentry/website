  During this year we host many events for the community including lab
  meetings, sub-committees and de/briefing sessions.  Unfortunately we
  fail to let everyone know of the events and to try solve this
  problem next year we are launching
  a <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=oseuuoht0tvjbokgg3noh8c47g%40group.calendar.google.com">community
  calendar</a>.  If you want to add the community calendar into your
  agenda you should
  use <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/oseuuoht0tvjbokgg3noh8c47g%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics">https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/oseuuoht0tvjbokgg3noh8c47g%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics</a>.
