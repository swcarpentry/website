  About a year ago, I hoped to help answer the question, "Is our
  students learning?" We are now a bit closer to an answer, and I
  wanted to update the community about what we have accomplished this
  year. First, I want to thank and acknowledge
  the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/03/scf-subcommittees.html">assessment
  subcommittee</a>
  and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/pages/team.html#joyce.blake">Blake
  Joyce</a>, who helped to define tasks, possibilities, and provided
  significant feedback. Especially here I wanted to thank Daniel Chen,
  Jeramia Ory, and Rayna Harris who put in a lot of hours moving
  things along.

<h2>Where are we today and why</h2>
<p>
  Currently, we have three surveys, all of which you can preview at
  the links below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/create/survey/preview?r=true&amp;sm=16wnNYRoEi2P3fwKZMLuYLvbImRjqbWn7MjeBqePiD54hm1Qqmnn2nJjrLhl1_2FBZ3DLZSM01zZnC7tJS5NyYHw_3D_3D">Pre-workshop Survey</a></strong>:
      Basic information about learner capabilities and attitudes
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/create/survey/preview?r=true&amp;sm=ySIDD9XyFd7AhG8X2dg4nRnnOvmbA5XNoExtfTkaua2YJZPkE5CfZRPCjTZwwxDK61_2Fv53FnwF7Oj2WcYPYSoA_3D_3D">Post-workshop Survey</a></strong>:
      Feedback on the perceived effectiveness of the workshop,learner
      motivation, and confidence
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/create/survey/preview?r=true&amp;sm=H57qUiV6Bgv06Szlepvw8b4t0eqmlsA3FnOb6kChQ4Idxqt4R_2BFg1Y8mHGZadYGMS1JqOnyn8RMfJqbrpL_2BRBg_3D_3D">Long-term Survey</a></strong>:
      Determine impacts and outcomes for learners after attending a
      workshop
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  As it turns out, there aren't widely accepted and standardized ways
  to evaluate workshops like these. We apply evidence-based teaching
  techniques designed for the classroom, but resemble science museums
  that try to teach within a very short exposures. Our teaching
  materials might have been done as an online or self-paced course,
  but we use socially driven in-person workshops. Given these
  complexities, here are are some of the questions that drove these
  surveys:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Do we create a learning environment that is welcoming and
      inclusive?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Can we generate feedback for our instructors that will help them
      improve?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      What do learners think they know before/after our workshops?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Are we lowering anxieties and barriers to learning the topics we
      teach; are we motivating learners?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      What positive outcomes do learners attribute to their Software
      Carpentry experience?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Who are our learners, and are we setting and meeting goals for
      diversity?
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We <em>think</em> these are reasonable questions given our context
  and constraints. We know that a two-day workshops are not going to
  change learners into experts, but we do think we can set a lot of
  learners down the path to competency within the best practices of
  software use in their respective sciences.
</p>
<h2>What instructors need to know</h2>
<p>
  <strong>The most important task for instructors is to remind (and
  provide time for) learners to complete the surveys</strong>. These
  surveys will not only help Software Carpentry do a better job in
  general, but will generate feedback that help you to improve
  personally. I like emphasize to the learners that these data are
  important to us, and we really need them to contribute to this.
</p>
<h2>Survey Workflow</h2>
<h3>Survey Setup</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Links to the survey are part of the workshop template. These
      should automatically be a part of your agenda. When your agenda
      becomes public to your learners, you can remind them to take the
      pre-survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      During the survey, learners will select your workshop from a
      list ('which workshop are you attending' Q3 on pre-survey, Q2 on
      post-survey). Check this question to see your workshop is
      listed. If not, check with admin@software-carpentry.org. Adding
      workshop sites is a <em>manual</em> step for us, and if
      something was overlooked, there will be an option for the
      learner to just type in the workshop name. The survey link
      generated when you create your workshop template also encodes
      information on the workshop ID; a backup against mistakes in
      user input.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Administering surveys</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      In any reminders or communications to learners before the
      workshop, please remind learners to take the pre-survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remind learners to take the pre-survey if they haven't done so
      before you begin day one.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      On day two, leave extra time for learners to take the
      post-survey. The best way to ensure a high-completion rate is to
      ask your learners to complete this survey <strong>before they
      leave</strong> the workshop. Please allow time for this, and for
      learners that must leave, remind them that they can still
      complete this at home.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The admin will send the long-term follow up survey to learners
      after the workshop by email.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Viewing survey results</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      The Software Carpentry administrator will generate a URL for you
      that will enable you to view survey responses to both the pre
      and post workshop surveys. These will also be visible to the
      mentors at the workshop debriefs.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Like everything Software Carpentry, this effort is open to and
  benefits from your feedback. Since we are using Survey Monkey the
  usual methods of making pull requests aren't possible. There may be
  a better way to make changes, but for now suggestions should be sent
  to the
  <a href="mailto:assessment@lists.software-carpentry.org">assessment list</a>.
</p>
<h2>What do we do next</h2>
<p>
  As good a start as this is, we still have lots more we want to
  do. First, thanks to Data Carpentry we will be getting some
  professional assessment help from a dedicated evaluator. At the very
  least, we think our efforts so far will create a great starting
  point for improved assessments. There are still many questions that
  we will need more effort to get at including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      What is the best way to get live feedback during our teaching?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Can we get a more quantitative understanding of what skills our
      learners have and if they are improved by our workshops?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      What misconceptions do our learners have and how do we address
      them?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      How can we get more fine-grained feedback on individual lessons?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      How can all of this be integrated
      with <a href="{{site.github_url}}/amy">AMY</a> to
      make it easier for our instructors and organization to react to
      collected feedback?
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We have some ideas on this that will have to wait for another blog
  post. As we get more data, we will want to regularly report on what
  we have been learning, and over the past month we have already
  collected more than 200 responses. For now though, please let us
  know both about your opinions on what we have done so far, and what
  should come next.
</p>
