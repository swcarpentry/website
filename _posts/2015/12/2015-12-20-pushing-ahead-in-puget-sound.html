  As regular readers will know,
  our instructor training classes are heavily over-subscribed:
  even after the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/12/three-flavors-of-instructor-training.html">classes we ran this fall</a>,
  we still have over 400 people on our waiting list,
  some of whom have been there for months.
</p>
<p>
  One of these is Billy Charlton,
  who works for the <a href="http://www.psrc.org/">Puget Sound Regional Council</a>.
  Keen to sharpen his team's technical skills,
  and unable to wait any longer for a training course,
  he taught himself as much as he could about what and how we teach,
  then went ahead and ran a workshop using our materials.
  His <a href="http://psrc.github.io/2015/software-carpentry/">report on his experiences</a>
  is inspiring,
  as is the feedback he received from participants,
  and a great way to end a busy year.
