  In my experience, the term "educational engineers" doesn't seem to
  have caught on to describe any particular activity, but I can
  provide some examples of people bringing ideas from the research to
  inform teaching.  There's a range depending on what counts as
  "building".

  The "Scholarship of Teaching and Learning" generally refers to
  efforts of individuals involved in post-secondary teaching to
  improve their teaching by getting ideas from the research
  literature, collecting evidence, and reporting back in publications
  and presentations.  "Action Research" is largely along the same
  lines, though tends to be the term used more in K-12 settings.  More
  substantial research programmes that may involve non-instructor
  researchers and an attempt to discover more generalizable results
  within the teaching of a certain field can fall under the heading of
  "Discipline-Based Education Research", for example the development
  of a reliable concept inventory to measure student learning and
  misconceptions with respect to a certain topic.  These are all
  related and there aren't especially clear divisions between these
  spheres
  (<a href="http://www.unl.edu/dber/action-research-sotl-dber">more
  detail here</a>) but in terms of educational research overall these
  are on the very applied end, usually involving studies in actual
  classrooms and very connected to the teaching culture within the
  particular field.

  For about 8 years now at the University of British Columbia, we have
  had the <a href="http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/">Carl Wieman Science
  Education Initiative</a>, which uses a model of discipline-based
  experts (usually people with a graduate degree in the relevant field
  of science and some teaching experience) embedded in our science
  departments to collaborate with faculty on improving teaching.  This
  includes measuring of student learning and reporting out as
  possible, where published work would tend to be considered
  Discipline-Based Education Research.  Our local title for these
  people is "Science Teaching and Learning Fellow", but with their
  strong focus on implementation of research-based teaching practices,
  I have described them as "educational engineers" sometimes (I am
  currently coordinating the initiative).  The University of Colorado
  at Boulder had a similar initiative that has already wound up, and
  many institutions are now attempting some form of the model of
  embedded experts working with faculty on teaching improvement
  projects.  I should add that a portion of the funding has gone to
  buying out teaching of faculty in order for them to be able to
  participate in these projects (e.g., teach one fewer course in a
  year) which creates the extremely important "time for practice" that
  Greg mentions.
