Organizing one workshop isn't easy
and sometimes things out of your control go wrong in the last minute
like the internet access on the room is very slow.
After months of discussions of what could be done to help instructors
and hosts when organizing their workshops and being prepared for the show time
the Mentoring Subcommittee decided to test some helping sessions.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The first help session will happen on
<a href="http://pad.software-carpentry.org/pre-workshop-morning">December 9th at 3PM UTC</a>
and <a href="http://pad.software-carpentry.org/pre-workshop-evening">December 10th at 12PM UTC</a>
to accommodate different timezones.
Connection instructions can be found in the previous links.
</p>
<p>
We invite everyone committed with one upcoming workshop, independently of the
organization stage (before decide dates, preparing workshop homepage,
registrations in progress, reviewing lessons),
to join the help session, share experience, have a good discussion
and meet others instructors.
</p>
<p>
If you can't attend this first help session, don't worry.
There will be a second help session on the begin of 2016,
date need to be defined,
and it will probably become a regular event.
More important, if you want a one-to-one chat about the workshop you are
organizing or going to teach we are happy to do that;
just email <a href="mailto:mentoring@lists.software-carpentry.org">mentoring@lists.software-carpentry.org</a>.
