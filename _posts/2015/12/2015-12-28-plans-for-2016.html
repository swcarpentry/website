  Twelve months is a long time.
  A year ago
  I was wrapping up my second month without an income
  and had serious doubts about whether Software Carpentry was going to be viable.
  Today,
  our new <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/10/more-about-jonah-duckles.html">Executive Director</a>
  and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/11/introducing_maneesha.html">Program Coordinator</a>
  are in place,
  our <a href="{{site.github_url}}/amy/">workshop administration tool</a> is ticking over nicely,
  we're about to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/12/call-for-candidates-elections-2016.html">elect our second Steering Committee</a>,
  we've <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/12/call-for-candidates-elections-2016.html">published our lessons</a>,
  we have a growing number of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/scf/partners/">partners and affiliates</a>,
  our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/09/rebooting-instructor-training.html">reboot of instructor training</a>
  has <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/12/three-flavors-of-instructor-training.html">taught us a lot</a>,
  and those are just the things I've bookmarked.

<p>
  But it's been a <a href="http://third-bit.com/2015/09/22/dad.html">difficult</a>
  <a href="http://third-bit.com/2015/11/09/daddy-why-dont-you-ever-laugh.html">year</a>
  for me personally,
  one that has prompted <a href="http://third-bit.com/2015/12/18/why-i-teach.html">considerable</a>
  <a href="http://third-bit.com/2015/12/27/actually-an-engineer.html">reflection</a>.
  Based on that and discussions with people in the two Carpentries,
  I'm going to work on instructor training full-time for the whole of 2016.
  The <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/instructor-training">notes</a> need to be polished,
  the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/12/instructor-training-checkout-procedure.html">checkout procedure</a>
  needs to become routine,
  I need to train more people to run the course on their own,
  and there's plenty of other things to keep me busy.
  And who knows?
  I may finally finish one of the
  <a href="http://sensibleadventures.com/and-then/">books</a>
  <a href="http://sensibleadventures.com/still/still-the-whole-story/">for</a>
  <a href="http://sensibleadventures.com/works-in-progress/madica/">children</a>
  that I've been working on.
</p>
<p>
  So to close out my last post of 2015,
  I'd like to say how grateful I am to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/scf/members/">everyone</a>
  who has given Software Carpentry their time and energy this year.
  It has been a privilege to work with you,
  and I look forward to helping you help even more people in 2016.
