  The <a href="">Software Sustainability Institute</a>,
  a partner organization which is committed to cultivating world-class research through software,
  has received &pound;3.5M in funding to continue its valuable support for the UK's research software community.
  Two new funders,
  the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),
  have joined forces with the Institute's original funder,
  the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),
  to continue to invest in research that is underpinned by software until at least 2019.
  For the full announcement,

  Congratulations!
