  A couple of weeks
  ago <a href="http://pythonpodcast.com/maneesha-sane-software-data-carpentry.html">I
  was interviewed by the Podcast.__init__ team</a> to talk about
  Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry.  The request for an interview
  actually came in a couple of months ago and I asked Greg Wilson
  about doing it, telling him I was a big fan of the podcast. He said
  he'd be happy to have me do it myself, giving me the chance to star
  in one of my favorite shows. I decided to do it, in pursuit of my
  goal of promoting Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry (and maybe
  more public exposure for myself).

  I'm so glad I got a chance to talk about Software Carpentry and Data
  Carpentry. The hosts were great to work with. In preparing for the
  interview, I realized what a unique space these programs occupy. The
  basics of software programming and data management are not taught by
  experts but rather by peers. The curriculum is also built and
  continues to grow by the efforts of these same instructors, based on
  their experience as researchers and scientists.  I'm hoping the
  podcast audience will find it equally exciting.
</p>
<p>
  Something that came up that I wish I emphasized more was the
  importance of "slowing down."  We talked about the importance of
  precoding work&mdash;writing in pseudocode, drawing flowcharts, etc.,
  before diving into the code. Whether it's getting scientists to
  specifically do any precoding work, or the larger idea of learning
  software skills at all, taking the time to stop and learn to be more
  efficient and productive has big long term payoffs.
</p>
<p>
  One big thing I realized after taping&mdash;I don't have a "radio
  voice." I say "um" a LOT.  It's not really a big deal when speaking
  live, because I can integrate those pauses using facial expressions
  or body language, or the old trick of pausing for a sip of water or
  to pick up a pen. I also feel like not using them at all makes my
  speech sound more rehearsed and less natural. When I'm a disembodied
  voice though, those vocal fillers become much more pronounced. I
  need to find a balance here.
</p>
<p>
  A side note to close on&mdash;I
  think <a href="http://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> comes up in pretty much
  every conversation that's related to science and technology. In this
  case, it was in the case of <a href="https://xkcd.com/149/">"sudo"
  trying to tell someone to do something</a>. I was talking about why
  I often prefer working with computers to working with humans.  Once
  you learn their language, computers always do only and exactly what
  you tell them to do.  When was the last time a human did that?  If
  you don't know this web comic and you're a science and technology
  nerd&mdash;check it out.
