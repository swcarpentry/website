Data science faces
<a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/08/22/hacking-academia/">many challenges</a>
in the traditional academic setting. At the same time, many research fields are
becoming increasingly dependent on data science tools and techniques. A key
element in tackling these challenges is the education of a new generation of
researchers that are fluent in both their research domain and in data science
methodologies. In this post, we discuss an immersive approach to training in
data science, the University of Washington eScience Institute's inaugural
<a href="http://escience.washington.edu/get-involved/data-science-for-social-good/">Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) program</a>.

<p>
The eScience Institute promotes data science within the university setting,
and more broadly across traditional boundaries of disciplinary and institutional
research. With support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Gordon &amp;
Betty Moore Foundation, we have, together with the
<a href="http://bids.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley Institute for Data Science </a>,
and the <a href="http://cds.nyu.edu/">NYU Center for Data Science</a>, embarked
on an experiment to create an environment for data science on the university
campus. You can learn more about this effort <a href="http://msdse.org/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
In our DSSG program, we took elements of our successful
<a href="http://escience.washington.edu/data-science-winter-2016-incubator-program/">Data Science Incubator</a> model
and combined them with elements from
fellowship programs at the <a href="http://dssg.io/">University of Chicago</a> and <a href="http://dssg-atl.io/">Georgia Tech</a> focused on
DSSG. To give the program a coherent thematic focus, and dovetailing with our
involvement in a <a href="http://urban.uw.edu/">campus-wide initiative on urban studies</a>, we collaborated with organizations focused on urban issues
in the Seattle region that could be tackled using data science. In
collaboration with <a href="http://thirdplacetechnologies.com/">Third Place Technologies</a>,
we created a <a href="http://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2015-wellbeing/">neighborhood well-being report based on open data and social media</a>.
We assessed factors that influence the chances of <a href="http://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2015-predicting-permanent-housing/">homeless families transitioning into permanent housing</a>
in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>.
Two projects, conducted in collaboration with the
<a href="https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/">UW Taskar Center for Accessible Technology</a>
addressed access for individuals with low mobility:
the <a href="http://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2015-paratransit/">efficient deployment of paratransit</a>
and the creation of <a href="http://uwescience.github.io/DSSG_sidewalk/2015/08/28/Sidewalks-Project-Summary.html">routing maps that take into account accessibility</a>.
</p>
<p>
Each project had a 4-student team of DSSG Fellows working full-time throughout
the summer. Applications came from students with a wide variety of academic
backgrounds, and we were able to select an excellent and diverse cohort of
undergraduate and graduate students from social and natural sciences
(sociology, geography, astronomy), professional fields (mechanical engineering,
business, planning, GIS) and mathematical sciences (computer science,
statistics, applied math, informatics).
</p>
<p>
There is much to say about the goals and impact of the DSSG projects
themselves, but here we focus on our experiences with the pedagogical component
of the program. An important part of the fellows' experience was the
opportunity to learn a variety of data science tools in a formal setting,
through lectures and tutorials. For example, the second week of the program
included the option to join the Software Carpentry workshop that was held at
the eScience Institute that week. Participating in this workshop proved helpful
in "leveling the playing field", especially for those entering the program with
little previous programming experience. Several other tutorials focused on
additional tools, ranging from Tableau and D3, to applications of machine
learning (a tutorial led by one of the student fellows!), and to more advanced
topics such as object-oriented programming. A half-day workshop run by members
of the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/about-us/working-groups/reproducibility-and-open-science/">eScience Reproducibility and Open Science working group</a>
focused specifically on techniques for reproducible research.
</p>
<p>
In addition to these formal settings, the program provided daily opportunities
for students to learn from each other and from their data science mentors
through the experience of conducting research, writing analysis software, and
communicating the results to each other and to project stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
We see several advantages for this type of training:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Learning by doing is particularly important when it comes to
      computational thinking. Lorena Barba explains this in
      a <a href="http://bids.berkeley.edu/resources/videos/computational-thinking-and-pedagogy-computable-content">recent
      talk she gave at the UC BIDS</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Motivation is a huge factor in learning. Not many class assignments
      are as motivating as a real-world problem with tangible social impact.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Buying into tools and practices that increase productivity and
      reproducibility takes time. Instructors of Software Carpentry
      know this: the first time you teach students how and why to use
      tools like git and Github, you often get blank stares. Students
      often only appreciate the advantages of these tools after a few
      weeks of use. In this case, the extended period of using these
      tools on a daily basis, and the specific context of a team
      project allowed the students time to "buy-in". A common theme in
      the feedback we solicited at the end of the program was how much
      students enjoyed using git and Github, but only after it really
      "clicked" for them.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Collaboration in teams leads naturally to
      peer-instruction. Intentionally selecting teams of students with
      diverse backgrounds and varying levels of technical skill can
      create some challenges, but also allows for tremendous growth as
      each individual can be both a mentor and a mentee.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Close mentorship enables scaffolding of skills. The notion of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding">scaffolding</a>
      grew out of Vygotsky's theory of development and learning. It
      refers to teaching that is based on things that a learner is
      able to do when working together with a mentor, even though that
      learner may not be able to do these things without the mentor’s
      presence. In Vygotsky’s theory, this "Zone of Proximal
      Development" serves as a crucial step in the development of
      skills. In our case, a relatively high ratio of
      mentors-to-students allowed students to build up their skills
      very quickly, through the process of close work with the
      mentors.
    </p>
</li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Collaboration builds "soft skills". The nature of the DSSG
      teamwork allows for the development of skill that are essential
      in research collaborations, and are best learned through direct
      experience. For example, there were occasions for the students
      to manage workflows, communicate with numerous stakeholders,
      accommodate a variety of personal work styles, and translate
      between disciplinary-specific language and knowledge bases.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Real-world application makes critical reflection about the role
      of data science less abstract. In the DSSG setting, students had
      the opportunity to critically reflect on the application of data
      science to real world social issues. They participated in both
      spontaneous and facilitated group discussions about ethical,
      political, methodological, and epistemological challenges of
      collecting and analyzing data about the social world.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
We also realize the future impact that this type of educational activity can
have on our student fellows, when participants come back to the Data Science
Studio to take part in Software Carpentry as helpers and instructors.
