  The following exchange (lightly edited) took place on Twitter
  <a href="https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown/status/679795880912760832">a few days ago</a>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Titus Brown: bash is disastrous for pipelines! very hard to rerun entire analysis from bash script.</li>
  <li>Titus Brown: I <em>want</em>/we <em>need</em> dependency management in scientific computing workflows &amp; pipelines. bash doesn't provide.</li>
  <li>Lorin Hochstein: I am always saddened at the poor state of scientific workflow tools. Isn't that why we invented computers?</li>
  <li>Konrad Hinsen: We use completely inadequate tools and notations for computational science.</li>
  <li>Titus Brown: nothing personal, but I'm wary of you &amp; Greg Wilson when you make comments like this.</li>
  <li>Titus Brown: you're not wrong, but I have watched people try to build new/better sci sw &amp; fail &amp; fail.</li>
  <li>Titus Brown: I now believe wholeheartedly in iterative approach: small steps. But, more generally, when &gt; 5% of scientists <em>use the tools we have</em>, I will acknowledge need for new tools.</li>
  <li>David Soergel: I get it, but also better tools &rArr; more users!</li>
  <li>Titus Brown: you are (in my experience) largely mistaken, good sir.</li>
  <li>David Soergel: Really? Git (&amp;GitHub) profoundly better than CVS&amp;Subversion; lots more scientists use it...</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Titus, Lorin, Konrad, and David are all better scientists than I've ever been,
  but they're making a lot of shaky claims in these ten tweets.
  Are today's tools and notations for computational science actually inadequate?
  Do less than 5% of scientists use the tools we have?
  Do better tools actually generate more users?
  Is Git really better than CVS or Subversion?
  People who do empirical studies of software engineers would probably say,
  "We don't know how to measure that,"
  "We don't know,"
  "Unproven,"
  and, "That study hasn't been done, but probably not for most users" respectively.
</p>
<p>
  I've made lots of similar claims (hence Titus's wariness).
  Today,
  having worked beside scientists almost daily for six years,
  I'm less sure of myself.
  I <em>think</em> that Git is much harder for novices to learn than Subversion,
  but I don't have any data to back up that claim.
  What I <em>know</em> is that most debate about software engineering is unscientific:
  people neither cite studies nor expect to be asked to do so,
  not even within computer science.
</p>
<p>
  This is why I want to
  <a href="http://third-bit.com/2014/10/02/a-better-software-engineering-course.html">teach CS students the scientific method</a>:
  I believe that if they know how to gather and analyze data,
  they'll build tools that are actually better.
  It's why I wish the Python and Julia communities would test features
  &agrave; la <a href="http://neverworkintheory.org/2014/01/29/stefik-siebert-syntax.html">Stefik et al</a>
  before adding them to the language,
  and why I think <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/12/assessment-update.html">assessing Software Carpentry properly</a>
  has to be a priority in 2016.
</p>
<p>
  That's why I'm going to focus on <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/instructor-training/">instructor training</a>
  for the next twelve months.
  Six years ago,
  I had no idea how much we know about learning and teaching.
  I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface,
  but what little I've digested has already made me more effective.
  The most useful thing I can do right now is pass on a few key findings,
  the realization that we actually know stuff,
  and the belief that if we want the public to pay attention to <em>our</em> research
  it's hypocritical of us to ignore what our peers have discovered.
</p>
<p>
  I'm also going to try to think about how Software Carpentry fits into a bigger picture
  that includes open science
  and <a href="http://third-bit.com/2015/12/18/why-i-teach.html">social responsibility</a>.
  A <a href="http://third-bit.com/2015/09/22/dad.html">combination</a>
  of <a href="http://third-bit.com/2015/11/09/daddy-why-dont-you-ever-laugh.html">events</a>
  encouraged me to do a lot of reflecting this year;
  I haven't enjoyed the process,
  but it's helped me realize that my next steps are actually on a path of some kind,
  even if I don't yet know where it leads.
