  We have wanted for some time to give newly-trained instructors more
  experience with workshop materials and our teaching methods before
  sending them into the field. The mentoring committee and other
  community members have now created a proposal for doing this, and
  would like to test it out early in 2016 with participants in the two
  training session that ran this fall.  We have therefore
  created <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tUGvHb3ByzE5Dji8PUD94mI_UaMywER2Cx5J5-b5Y-s/viewform">a short questionnaire</a>
  to find out whether our plan is feasible and takes us in the right
  direction.

<p>
  In brief, trainees will be put into groups of 3-4 people and matched
  with a mentor. Each group will then work through the core lesson
  materials for Software or Data Carpentry over four weeks (depending
  on which they plan to teach). Each group will meet weekly with their
  mentor, who will guide them though the lesson and answer questions
  on it.
</p>
<p>
  After the four weeks, each trainee will prepare a one-hour lesson,
  find a local audience such as their lab group or other colleagues,
  and teach them the lesson. The mentor will help trainee figure out
  how to present the material, then observe the trainee's teaching
  (either live or recorded) and give her feedback.
</p>
<p>
  The mentoring program will take 5-8 weeks depending on how quickly
  each group moves. We expect trainees to spend 3-5 hours/week working
  on the lessons and 1-2 hours/week preparing and teaching their
  lesson.
</p>
<p>
  The mentors are obviously crucial to this process, so we are looking
  for instructors who have taught at least three times to fill this
  role. Each mentor will be matched with two groups of trainees
  (depending on time zones and similar factors) Mentors will be given
  extra training before and during this program on subjects like
  giving feedback. Mentoring guides for each lesson will also be
  developed to help guide discussion with groups.
</p>
<p>
  We expect each mentor to spend 1-3 hours/week.  All instructors that
  participate as mentors will be recognized on the Software Carpentry
  and Data Carpentry web sites. It will also count as teaching a
  workshop, which makes this a good way of participating in the
  Carpentry community for those who find traveling difficult.
</p>
<p>
  This proposal is a change that we think will help new
  instructors. We also think that it will give existing instructors
  new ways to learn more about teaching, and about our
  lessons. However, we need your help to make it work, so please take
  three minutes to answer <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tUGvHb3ByzE5Dji8PUD94mI_UaMywER2Cx5J5-b5Y-s/viewform">the questionnaire</a>.
