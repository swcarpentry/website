  We are pleased to announce that the lessons for our instructor training course
  are now available <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/instructor-training/">online</a>
  and in <a href="{{site.github_url}}/instructor-training">this GitHub repository</a>.
  They have evolved a lot in the three and a half years since we started running this class,
  and more improvements would be welcome:
  please file issues or send pull requests to fix, extend, or otherwise improve the material.
