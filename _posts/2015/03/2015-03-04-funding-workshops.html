<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>Software Carpentry workshops are taught by volunteers, but hosts need to
fund instructor travel, accommodation as well as our
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_cost">administrative fees</a>
of $750-$1250. While these costs are low, it can sometimes be a
challenge to get funding for your first workshop, especially if others are
unfamiliar with SWC. Here are some successful strategies that
hosts have used to fund workshops:</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Faculty and department grants</strong>: Most workshops are funded
  by small miscellaneous travel or seminar funds administered by individual
  faculty members and departments.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Training grants</strong>: Institutions or departments often have
  training grants that are relatively flexible. These are an excellent source
  of funds, as SWC workshops often fulfill their mandate to provide
  extra-curricular training. Find the gatekeepers of these grants at your
  institution. One possible angle is to fund the SWC through the
  <em>Responsible Conduct of Research</em> training requirement of many such
  grants.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Get outside the department</strong>: Centers, institutes, and
  other organizations besides academic departments are often more flexible with
  funds. Anything with computational/data science / translational science /
  interdisciplinary science in its mission is a likely target. Organizers have
  also had success working with libraries, graduate student/<a href=
  "http://uaw5810.org/">postdoc unions</a>, and many other non-departmental
  groups.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Share costs</strong>: If you can demonstrate interest from one
  department, you can approach others for matching funds. Remember that you can
  fill part of the budget with small workshop fees of $20-$40 (This also
  reduces the number of no-shows from 20-25% to about 5%.)</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Move up the food chain</strong>: Deans and higher-ups in the
  university control more money than department heads. After a couple of no
  answers at the department or center level, it makes sense to approach the
  dean of your college or graduate school. When working with deans, it's useful
  to have a faculty ally.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Organize as a group</strong>: You'll often have greater success
  appealing for funds as an organized group of students (and ideally faculty)
  than as an individual.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>External funding</strong>: It's a slower process getting external
  funding, but you can write SWC training explicitly into future grants. Some
  external groups funders (such as <a href=
  "https://orau.org/university-partnerships/faculty-student-programs/default.aspx">
  Oak Ridge Affiliated Universities</a>) have explicit small money pots for
  small events.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Other notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Make sure you have a well-estimated budget, and ask for the high-end
  estimate. You don't want to have to go back for for more after realizing
  that you underestimated costs.</p></li>

  <li><p>Don't ask for recurring funds the first time you fund a workshop, but be
  sure to collect information from the workshop to make the case for future
  workshops. This can include feedback from participants via in-workshop post-its,
  post-workshop surveys, and attendance figures, including what
  departments/groups attendees came from.</p></li>
</ul>
