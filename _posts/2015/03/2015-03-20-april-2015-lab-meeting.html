  The next Software Carpentry online lab meeting will take place on Wednesday, April 1 (no, really)
  at 10:00 and 19:00 Eastern time.
  (As usual, we will hold the meeting twice to accommodate people in different time zones.)
  Please sign up on <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-lab-meeting-2015-04-01">this Etherpad</a>
  to let us know whether you'll be attending,
  and if so,
  and what time.
  We'll post an agenda next week;
  if there's anything you'd particularly like to discuss,
  please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@software-carpentry.org">let us know</a>.
