  What do you have in your knapsack when you travel to teach a workshop?
  My list is:
</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
  <li>cough drops</li>
  <li>spare t-shirt (and deodorant)</li>
  <li>a variety of video adapters</li>
  <li>spare power adapter</li>
  <li>laptop stickers</li>
  <li>toothbrush (or mouthwash, or something of similar utility)</li>
  <li>granola bar (or some other snack)</li>
  <li>my daughter's latest art project</li>
  <li>Eno (or other antacid, because road food)</li>
  <li>sticky notes</li>
  <li>business cards</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Other people at this week's instructor training session added:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a printed copy of notes (for reference during teaching)</li>
  <li>insulated cup for tea/coffee</li>
  <li>spare glasses/contacts</li>
  <li>paper (notebook) and pen</li>
  <li>a <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/devices/chromecast/">Chromecast</a> for streaming</li>
  <li>some sort of WiFi hub (in case networking in the room isn't working)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  What else do <em>you</em> take, and why?
