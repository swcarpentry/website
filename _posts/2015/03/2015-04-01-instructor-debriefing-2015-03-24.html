  We held our sixth round of post-workshop debriefing last week. We
  discussed the Software Carpentry workshops held at the University of
  Arkansas, Utah State University, the University of Waterloo and the
  first Software Carpentry workshop ever held in Korea at the Korea
  Radio Promotion Association (and yes we now have lesson translated
  in Korean)! We were also joined by a Data Carpentry instructor who
  taught in a recent workshop at Espoo, Finland.

<p>
  We covered a wide-range of topics, from the awesome power of using
  of two instructors to teach version control to how to create a warm
  environment where everyone feels comfortable enough to
  participate. The topic of two instructors with one projector
  (sharing the cord back and forth) or two projectors, has come up on
  the discuss list recently as well and feedback from all instructors
  that we have talked to who have tried this have said it has been a
  very positive experience. One experienced instructor commented that
  when they tried this at their last workshop it was the best
  Git/Github learning experience they had ever witnessed. This has
  been added as a suggestion in the instructors notes (see
  the <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/instructors.html">Collaboration</a>
  section).
</p>
<p>
  Two projectors were also noted to be very useful outside of the
  version control lessons at the University of Arkansas where code was
  projected on a separate screen; this allowed those who fell behind
  to easily catch up and facilitated challenge questions.
</p>
<p>
  Participation and peer programming were reported to be challenges at
  workshops in Finland and Korea, respectively. Cultural differences
  between Europe and North America were hypothesized to be one of
  underlying causes for lack of participation, and a less than ideal
  room setup (multi-level-style lecture hall) prevented effective pair
  programming in Korea. But when faced with such challenges, how do we
  work with them? What can we do to promote participation and sharing
  in the face of cultural or other barriers?
</p>
<p>
  When we discussed this at the debrief an experienced instructor
  shared that he has found ice breakers on the first morning of the
  workshop to be important if workshop participants are from different
  research groups and do not know each other. As for promoting peer
  programming in a less-than-ideal room setup, instructors may have to
  be more active in encouraging students to move to sit
  together. Explaining the reasons for pair programming may lead to
  more buy-in from the students to follow these suggestions.
</p>
<p>
  One other intriguing topic that arose during the debrief was the
  presentation of a one hour capstone example (to illustrate how all
  the tools we teach can be integrated together) at the end of the
  workshop at Utah State University. The instructors reported that the
  capstone lesson went over very well. Amazingly, 50% of the positive
  feedback from this workshop were about the capstone lesson. We are
  interested to hear if anyone else has incorporated the capstone
  lesson in their workshop and whether or not the feedback from the
  students was as overwhelmingly positive.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, here is a list of some of the other good ideas and things to
  keep in mind when teaching, which arose during the debrief:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Walk students through help documentation, not only direct them to
    it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Show an example of using Git with an R or Python script.
  </li>
  <li>
    Practice live coding before the workshop.
  </li>
  <li>
    Have someone on the team who is familiar with Windows, Mac OS X and
    Linux operating system for solving configuration problems.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use symbolic registration fees to ensure a high attendance rate.
  </li>
</ul>
