  In the planning phase of organizing a Software Carpentry workshop
  for my home department of Molecular Biology &amp; Biochemistry
  I started to wonder what participants want to learn.
  I designed a short survey to answer this question,
  and from my small department,
  ~20% (30 people) filled it in.
  Here's what they said:

  (As with most good things in life,
  the code for these plots can be <a href="https://github.com/ttimbers/2015-03-30_SFU/blob/master/Survey/MBB_SWC_Survey.R">found on Github</a>.)
</p>
<p>
  I also asked survey participants to comment on any other computer programming and/or data science topics
  they would be interested in learning about.
  Here's what people said:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Circos plot!!!</li>
  <li>VBA (any level)</li>
  <li>Processing of strings as in sequencing data would be useful</li>
  <li>Reproducible Research and experimental planning, ensuring that experiments are</li>
  <li>well-designed, valid, reproducible and well-documented.</li>
  <li>Data visualization, both static and interactive</li>
  <li>S plus</li>
  <li>perl/latex</li>
  <li>Software to create nice figures and charts</li>
  <li>SAS</li>
  <li>Perl</li>
</ul>
<p>
  My takeaway from this survey that that people
  (well, at least Molecular Biologists and Biochemists)
  are most interested in learning R or Python (and not Matlab)
  and that we are on track with the level of focus for these workshops:
  the majority of people are interested in a workshop for novices.
</p>
<p>
  Disclaimer: This is a small survey (N = 30) and from a single discipline.
  I would be  very interested to hear and/or find out if these findings differ across disciplines and/or geography.
