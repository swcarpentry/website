  The Software Sustainability Institute's Collaborations Workshop 2015 (CW15),
  which will be held on March 25-27, 2015 in Oxford, UK,
  focusses on software, best practice and the social side of working past the boundaries of traditional disciplines and roles
  to accelerate research outcomes&mdash;or put differently,
  interdisciplinarity done right!
</p>
<p>
  What will you learn by attending:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The social and technical sides of interdisciplinary working.</li>
  <li>Examples of best practice of when it's been effective - and horror stories of when it has not.</li>
  <li>Examples of techniques and technologies that could be applied from one discipline to another - discipline hopping.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  CW15 brings together researchers, software developers, managers, funders, publishers and more
  to share practice, explore ideas, highlight problems
  and establish a community based understanding of the state of interdisciplinarity, collaboration and software.
</p>
<p>
  This will also be your chance to meet many of the Institute's <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/fellows">2015 Fellows</a>:
  ambassadors for software in their varied research domains,
  including physics, digital history, genetics, glaciology, addiction studies, systems biology,
  to programming languages and high performance computing.
</p>
<p>
  CW15 is an 'unconference' event and this interdisciplinarity theme will run through the schedule,
  which includes keynotes,lightning talks, demos, collaboration and discussion sessions,
  and concludes with this year's CW Hackday.
  The CW Hackday will focus on topics related to effective interdisciplinarity&mdash;reproducible research,
  data/code sharing, and data science&mdash;so you are free to bring your own data.
  There will be prizes for the best team efforts.
  The Hackday will start on the evening of March 26th after the main CW15 event.
  Please note attending the Hackday only is free but still requires registration.
