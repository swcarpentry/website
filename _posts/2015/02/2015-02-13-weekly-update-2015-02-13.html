    Greg posted a SWC-related <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/02/plot-this.html">visualisation challenge</a>
    and got some interesting suggestions.
    Do you want to turn Andrew Abela's guide to visualisation into a half-day SWC lesson?
    Please <a href="mailto:admin@software-carpentry.org">get in touch</a>.

     The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/02/instructor-debriefing-2015-02-10.html">third post-workshop debriefing</a>
     discussed several workshops where mostly R was taught.
     A few issues came up,
     including the benefits of having a single data set that runs through all of the lessons.
     This will be discussed in an upcoming lab meeting.
