  Greg Wilson and I recently hosted a second post-workshop debriefing
  session for January to capture more experiences and lessons learned
  from instructors in the field. This meeting was attended by 10
  instructors covering four recent workshops. We discussed how the
  workshops went, what worked, what didn't, and what could be
  improved.

<p>
  There is always something new to learn from instructors'
  experiences, particularly from this meeting, as we had the chance to
  discuss a Data Carpentry workshop at Cornell University as well as a
  three-day "Beyond the Code" workshop at the NERC/University of
  Leeds. Some highlights are discussed below. Please see
  the <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-debriefing-2015-01-27">etherpad</a>
  for detailed notes.
</p>
<h3>Instruction Methods and Technology</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dual screens were available at the University of Washington
    and Oxford workshops, which was reported to have worked very well.
    We've discussed before that it is helpful for the instructor to use a
    tablet (or second computer) to consult the lessons while live coding.
    Having two projectors seems to be even better by making it possible
    for the participants to refer to the lessons material while also
    keeping the code visible.</li>
  <li>Some take-home lessons were that live coding on screen is much
    better received than prepared slide decks. Also, you can't have too
    many hands-on exercises, which are popular with participants.</li>
  <li>Another common theme from this retrospective was that it was
    difficult to estimate and/or stick to lesson timing, which is probably
    related in part to new or newly refactored lesson materials.</li>
  <li>We've noticed in workshops that adoption and use of the
    etherpad can be somewhat spotty, not gaining traction or trailing off
    as the workshop proceeds. When the etherpad is actively used by the
    participants, it can be a very effective teaching adjunct and resource
    for real-time discussions, answers to common questions and helpful
    links. Almost all participants will be unfamiliar with the etherpad at
    the start or may not immediately see its value but, when it works,
    it works well and builds momentum. More active participants can be
    encouraged to post content as well to reduce the burden on the
    instructors and helpers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Carpentry Workshop at Cornell</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://emudrak.github.io/2015-01-15-cornell/">This workshop</a>
was run by Erika Mudrak (CSCU), Jeramia Ory (Kings College), and Emily
Davenport (Cornell University).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Covered Excel, Open Refine, SQL, R, and shell.</li>
  <li>OpenRefine, SQL and R were all very well received.</li>
  <li>Some technical issues.</li>
  <li>Some students were extremely under-prepared to use their own
    computer.</li>
  <li>Excel consumed a disproportionate amount of time.</li>
  <li>Most people were at a good level to learn and got something
    out of each part.</li>
  <li>Need to work on motivating participants to use each tool by
    introducing why it is helpful for them (but not all users have to use
    them all).</li>
  <li>A few personalities in the front of the room dominated the
    mood (also the under-prepared ones).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software Carpentry Workshop at the University of Leeds</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://andreww.github.io/2015-01-14-leeds/">This workshop</a>
was run by Martin Callaghan, Aleksandra Pawlik, Andrew Walker, Aaron
O'Leary and Peter Willetts. It was the second iteration of the "Beyond
the Code" format workshops held at Leeds, sponsosored by the Natural
Environment Research Council (NERC). The first two days are based on a
modified Software Carpentry workshop model. The third day of these
workshops was added to allow small groups of students to work together
to practice their skills and begin to develop software that may be
useful for their research projects.

See Andrew Walker's
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/12/an-advanced-short-course-in-leeds.html">post
on the Software Carpentry blog</a> for a detailed description of the
first such workshop.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Good things: the "day three mini-hacking" sessions seemed to
    work well. Git went down well with the participants.</li>
  <li>Problems: some minor time-keeping issues (probably worth
    having a plan for how to signal the teaching instructor during the
    lesson that time is passing), problems with etherpad (but less of a
    problem than in November), didn't always include enough hands-on
    during taught bits (setup of SWC lessons not great for this -
    challenges tend to be at the bottom). Fairly quiet group.</li>
  <li>Split into number of short sessions, opportunity for attendees
    to work at their own pace and lots of helpers and decent food and
    coffee!</li>
  <li>Superb organization- see Andrew above.</li>
  <li>Would like to develop this towards a more problem-solving
    approach and applying some flipped-teaching principles to allow people
    to work at their own pace.</li>
  <li>Pre-planning was essential. We spend quite some time agreeing
    content and format, deciding who was goiung to do what and how and
    produced quite a detailed delivery plan (not that we followed it too
    closely...)</li>
  <li>Tried to make the Python materials a bit more bespoke to be
    relevant to our attendees. For example, I did a session on creating
    maps using Basemap and plotting data onto them. For one session, I
    used a very short set of slides to introduce session objectives and to
    summarize.</li>
  <li>We followed the material quite closely for Bash, went a bit
    beyond the Git material.</li>
</ul>
