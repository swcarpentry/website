    This week was one of the most exciting weeks in the history of Software Carpentry:
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/01/cast-your-vote.html">voting</a> for the 2015 Steering Committee took place,
    and the successful candidates were announced.
    Congratulations to Matt Davis, Adina Howe, Katy Huff, Karin Lagesen, Aleksandra Pawlik, Raniere Silva, and Jason Williams,

    The deadline for applying to

    Many of the Steering Committee candidates mentioned that they aim to work on ways to
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/01/the-other-ninety-percent.html">improve support for post-workshop participation</a>.
    Suggestions include the use of <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>,
    introducing a capstone project as part of the SWC workshop,
    and the possibility of adding a follow-up sprint 6-12 months after the first workshop.
    Please <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/01/the-other-ninety-percent.html">add comments</a> to share your ideas.
