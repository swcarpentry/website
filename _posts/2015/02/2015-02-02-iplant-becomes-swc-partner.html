  Joining with the SCF will further the iPlant Collaborative's mission
  to provide access to cyberinfrastructure for the broad life science community,
  said Nirav Merchant, Co-PI of iPlant
  and Director of <a href="http://bcf.arl.arizona.edu">Biocomputing</a>
  at <a href="http://www.arl.arizona.edu">Arizona Research Laboratories</a> at the University of Arizona.
  "In order to ensure efficient use of these scalable cyberinfrastructure resources,
  our users need the kind of training Software Carpentry provides,"
  said Merchant.
  "This partnership allows iPlant to reach out to a much wider audience
  and it provides the synergies for developing and delivering new learning material.
  Through Software Carpentry's global network of volunteer instructors,
  iPlant can provide the background computational skills
  absolutely essential for effective use of national and international cyberinfrastructure."

  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,
  and University of North Carolina at Wilmington.
