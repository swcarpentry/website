  Since its creation in 2008,
  the eScience Institute has worked to create the intellectual and physical infrastructure needed to meet
  the challenges of doing science in a world where new sources of large, complex, and noisy data
  are fundamentally changing the kinds of science questions we can answer.
  At the core of the eScience Institute are individuals who have proven track records
  in developing and applying advanced analytical techniques and technologies to real world problems.
  To support them,
  and the researchers that they support in turn,
  the institute engages in <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/what-we-do">a wide range of activities</a>
  including curricula, training, fellowships, software development, collaborative services, seminars,
  and core research in applied data science.
