<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>We had our fourth post-workshop debriefing of the year this week,
in which we discussed recent workshops at Jagiellonian University in
Krakow, Poland, and Michigan State University.  All four instructors
from the Krakow workshop attended the debriefing and we had a fairly
in-depth discussion about that workshop</p>

<h3>Jagiellonian University</h3>
<p>Paulina Lach, Leszek Tarkowski, Piotr Banaszkiewicz, and Klemens
Noga taught <a href="http://klemensnoga.github.io/2015-02-21-Krakow/">the
workshop</a> in Krakow, Feb 21-22, 2015.  Some general observations
about this workshop were that the etherpad and sticky notes were well
received and used throughout the workshop.  One of the helpers kept
the etherpad up-to-date through the workshop. 41 people were
registered at the workshop, of which 36 attended.  There was a small
amount of attrition of advanced participants on the second day.  At
this workshop, they collected informal feedback by sticky notes at the
end of each section, which the instructors found helpful.  They also
observed that the workshop participants transitioned from speaking in
formal honorifics, normally used in Polish in an academic context, to
addressing each other informally, which indicates a good comfort level
at the event.</p>
<p><b>Git:</b></p>
<p>The instructor covered Git in detail and taught accordingly to
Software Carpentry lesson.  The participants appreciated the provided
handout (<a href="http://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf">http://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf</a>), a
GitHub cheat sheet for Git, although some complained that the Git
lesson did not include all of the commands in the handout and would
have preferred to see a handout that more closely followed the lesson
plan.  A quick poll of showed that 14/22 people would have liked to
have used pair-githubbing as part of the Git lesson.  Generally, the
participants felt that the pace was good for Git.</p>
<p><b>Shell:</b></p>
<p>The stock "inflammation" lesson material was used.  The instructor
managed to teach from the beginning through to loops (5 lessons).</p>
<p>Participants were pleased with quizzes at the ending of each
lesson, especially the multiple choice questions.  Some were
disappointed that the lessons covered did not get as far as building
shell scripts.</p>
<p><b>Python:</b></p>
<p>The instructor started with the "inflammation" material, then used
his own examples to place more emphasis on "for" loops and "if"
statements (e.g. nested for loops).  At the end, the participants were
given the challenge of printing prime numbers in the [2,100] range to
the screen.  Two participants commented that the example was too
"mathematical".  The participants enjoyed the instructors' funny
anecdotes.  From quick feedback, almost equal number found the pace
"too fast" as did "too slow", which not all the unusual for workshops
with a mix of novice and advanced participants.</p>
<p><b>SQL:</b></p>
<p>There were some technical issues at the beginning.  This topic was
taught using the Firefox plugin for SQLite rather than the pure shell.
This was the last section taught at the workshop and time was limited,
so there was a feeling of being rushed.</p>
<h3>Beacon Center at Michigan State University</h3>
<p>Jiarong Guo reported on
the <a href="http://jrherr.github.io/2015-01-27-msu_icer/">introductory
python workshop</a> held at Michigan State University on January
28-29, 2015.  This workshop was structured as three half days, with
one each devoted to shell, Python and Git.</p>
<p>Basic Python (data type, variable, list, file stream) was taught
using more introductory lessons rather than the standard software
carpentry materials. The audience are mostly biologists with no
experience in Python or Git.  4/15 had some experience with the Unix
shell.  The instructors tried to make the materials as introductory as
possible. They felt that the Python materials on the Software
Carpentry GitHub repo were not basic enough for the audience and that
some introduction to basic Python data types was necessary.</p>
<p>Things worked well overall.  They spent some time explaining the
difference between shell (Bash), Python in the shell, and IPython
Notebook, as some participants were confused about these concepts
before.  Both Python in the shell and IPython Notebook were used
during the Python lessons.  Hand-on exercises for participants worked
really well.  When students were not interactive, the TAs helped out
by posing questions to the instructors. Some participants expressed
that there was not enough discussion prior to the hands-on exercises
and that they had no idea how to start.  Jirong mentioned that more
exercise collections in the repo would be nice.</p>
<h3>University of California at Irvine</h3>
<p>Jason Moore and Andrea Zonca reported by email about
the <a href="http://moorepants.github.io/2015-02-21-uci/">workshop at
UCI Data Science Initiative</a>, held February 21 and 22.  The
workshop went well.</p>
<p>Some specific notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final feedback from the students is at the bottom
of <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/2015-02-21-uci">this
etherpad</a></li>
<li>A large percentage of the group had knowledge of one or more
programming languages and most knew what variables and loops were. So
it was tough to balance going too fast or too slow. We saw this in the
pre assessment but still went with the standard material and adjusted
as we received feedback. Many people were eager for more intermediate
topics so we had a short intro to Pandas that Andrea developed, which
went well.</li>
<li>The hosts didn't understand what the sticky notes were for, nor
did they notice we needed multiple colors. So maybe that needs to be
made clearer in the workshop setup docs. <b>Note from Sheldon:</b>
This happens a lot, I noticed they sell post-its at the Dollar Tree,
so I will be bringing my own from now on.</li>
<li>There were ~50 students. The first day we had around 6 helpers and
it turned out to be more than we needed (probably because the group
was more intermediate level than novice at some topics). They used
only 3 helpers the second day.</li>
<li>No major technological hurdles. We tried the 5.3 Beta Python and
it was a little rough around the edges.  Better specify that nobody
should use 5.3 for now, it has big issues, like functions being
introduced in lesson 4 but used in 2.</li>
<li>It is important to add somewhere in the instructions that the best
way to deliver data files to students is with a <code>git pull</code>. It went well
at UCI, at UCLA the week before we tried with downloading zip archives
and it very time consuming.</li>
</ul>

debriefing meeting</a> will be held on Tuesday, March 10.</p>
