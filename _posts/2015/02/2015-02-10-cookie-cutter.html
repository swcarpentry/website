  I was first introduced to William Stafford Noble's paper
  "<a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424">A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects</a>"
  when Ivan Gonzalez and I taught Harvard last November.  Noble describes
  how scientists in Computational Biology should set up their
  project folders so code, results, outputs, figures, and papers are
  all in easily understandable locations.  He also writes about how
  one should run experiments (using driver scripts) to make workflows
  reproducible, readable, and understandable to others (and your
  future self).

  I recently reorganized a project I was working on to follow Nobe's
  folder structure, and when I started a new computational project, I
  realized I would have to create the same folder structure again.
  Since, we're in the business of not repeating ourselves, I created
  <a href="https://github.com/chendaniely/computational-project-cookie-cutter">a
  short Bash script</a> that implements the basic folder structure
  outlined by Noble.  When I brought up the project to our discussion
  board, Pat Schloss chimed in
  with <a href="https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-init">a
  similar project</a> based on the same motivational paper, and my
  project even got a pull request!

<p>
  "Cookie cutter" projects are
  <a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">quite</a>
  <a href="http://projecttemplate.net/">common</a> &mdash;
  essentially, they are pre-built templates for project that follow some kind of
  convention for folder structures and basic boilerplate.
</p>
<p>
  For Software Carpentry, it serves as a way for us to teach our
  attendees some
  <a href='http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745'>best practices</a>
  while showing them the importance of reproducibility and scripts.
  It also allows a low barrier of entry to actually set up a project
  folder structure, since re-organizing folders when a project is
  fully developed will most likely not happen.

  If you use cookie cutter project templates of some kind,
  we'd like to hear about them:
  please add pointers to
