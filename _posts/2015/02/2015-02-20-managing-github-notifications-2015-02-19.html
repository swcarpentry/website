<p>SWC has <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/lessons/">many GitHub
repositories</a> for lessons, websites, and workshops, and we have
many conversations about our work take place through GitHub issue
threads. Since GitHub creates e-mail notifications of repositories and
issues you participate in, that means you can quickly start getting
loads of e-mail.</p>
<p>While it's helpful to be kept abreast of developments on a project, if you
get a flood of GitHub messages you won't see what's important. Here's a quick
primer on fine-tuning your notifications so that you only see what you want,
gleaned from <a href="{{site.github_url}}/site/issues/813">this
helpful conversation</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You can "Watch" or "Unwatch" any GitHub <em>repository</em>, meaning you
    will get notifications from ALL discussions. This is a good idea for a
    repository that you are doing a lot of work on.</p>
    <p>Click <img src="{{site.filesurl}}/2015/02/watch_button.png"> at the top of a repository page to
    watch it. Go to <a href="https://github.com/watching">https://github.com/watching</a> to see what you are currently
    watching and unsubscribe from things you don't care about.</p>
    <p>If you are given push access to a repository, you'll automatically watch
    it. You can turn this off by unchecking "Automatic Watching" at
    <a href="https://github.com/settings/notifications">https://github.com/settings/notifications</a>
    so you're not signed up to watch stuff just because you've been
    given access to the git repo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are automatically "subscribed" to any <em>issue thread</em> that you
    start, comment on, or that someone <strong><span class=
    "citation">@mentions</span></strong> you in, even in unwatched
    repositories. This is useful but can get tedious if a conversation
    continues past your interest. You can unsubscribe from any of these threads
    by hitting the <img src="{{site.filesurl}}/2015/02/unsubscribe_button.png"> button on the right of
    that issue thread. You can do this as soon as you comment on an issue that
    you don't want to keep talking about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, you can filter your notifications at your e-mail client,
    instead. Both Gmail and Google Inbox have automated categories/bundles that
    filter GitHub notifications away from your primary mail, or you can set
    filters manually to filter notifications@github.com.</p>
    <p>Those who manage e-mail through self-hosted/command line tools may be
    interested in <a href="http://notmuchmail.org/">Notmuch</a>.</p>
    <p>If you go this route, and you're a member of the SWC GitHub
    organization, you can filter mail from SWC repositories using "Custom
    Routing" under
    <a href="https://github.com/settings/notifications">https://github.com/settings/notifications</a>.
    This lets you direct
    notifications from the SWC organization to a custom email address. For
    Gmail, you can take advantage of the ability to add whatever you want to
    your email with a "+", and send SWC mail to your.name+swc@gmail.com for
    filtering.</p>
