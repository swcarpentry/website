  During last week's Steering Committee meeting we talked about applying to
  <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015">Google Summer of Code</a>
  as a mentoring organization
  and decided to contact NumFOCUS to suggest that they
  applying as a umbrella organization for
  <a href="http://numfocus.org/projects/index.html">all the projects they support</a>.
  NumFOCUS agreed,
  and for the past few days we have been racing to fill in the application.
