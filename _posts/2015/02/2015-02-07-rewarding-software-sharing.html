  Sharing software you write with other scientists can magnify the impact of
  your research, but there can be a surprising amount of sometimes thankless
  extra work involved.  I work with a group at Carnegie Mellon's Institute for
  Software Research who have been asking scientists what that extra work is, and
  what motivates them to do it&mdash;despite a sometimes uncertain link between that
  extra work and the ways many of them are evaluated in their jobs.  We're
  looking at ways of measuring and mapping software and its impacts, in order
  to help scientists demonstrate the positive impact that
  their work on shared software has on science. We're running an experiment
  that you can help with.

<p>
  Uploading some code you've written onto a public repository like
  GitHub is easy, but it may invite some unexpected costs down the
  road<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  If you didn't
  document every last assumption you've made, every command-line
  option, every rationale for, for example, you're going to get
  questions about it.  If it's buggy, you'll be asked to fix it.  If
  it doesn't perform a Frobnitz analysis, someone will ask you to add
  it.
</p>
<p>
  You may struggle a bit to make time for that extra work.  Tenure
  committees and grant reviewers may care more about how many papers
  you've published than how many tests you've written or users you've
  supported, even though that support may indirectly be enabling a
  great deal of valuable research.  So if you don't want to skimp on
  software support, you might need to explicitly write that
  maintenance into your grants, your job description, or hire people
  to help. To do justify all this, you'd have to make a case that that
  work is really advancing science and not just keeping an old pet
  project on life support.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately it turns out to be fairly difficult to know what
  scientific impact a particular piece of open source software is
  really making.  You can collect download statistics, but it's hard
  to know how much usage a download represents, if any.  You can try
  to count citations in published papers that mention your software,
  but this task is daunting and unreliable: publications do not always
  mention all the software they use. For example I spot checked ten
  papers listed by researchers as justification for supercomputer
  time, to look for citations or mentions of a library they all
  used: <a href="http://www.fftw.org/">FFTW</a>, a popular fast
  Fourier transform library.  Only one mentioned the package, and only
  because the particulars of the algorithm were relevant to their
  research.  FFTW seems to be a real workhorse of scientific computing
  across many fields, but its citations don't reflect its apparently
  broad impact.
  Furthermore, <a href="http://james.howison.name/publications.html#cyberinfrastructure">James
  Howison</a> at the University of Texas has found<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>
  that even when scientific software is mentioned in papers, "only 37%
  of mentions involve formal citations, and only 28% provide any
  version information".
</p>
<p>
  The citation problem can't be completely laid at the feet of paper
  authors, however; practices and expectations differ by field, and it
  would be unwieldy to mention every library used by every program in
  one's workflow.
</p>
<p>
  So how can we get better information about scientific impact into
  the hands of scientific software authors? Two possible places for
  improvment are: how publications require, collect, and promulgate
  usage information, and how scientists' actual usage can be measured
  in the first place.
</p>
<p>
  From the perspective of the publications, there's a social/technical
  question of agreeing on appropriate citation practices for software,
  and technical ways of making that metadata usable and searchable.
  Several different groups of researchers have been pursuing this.
  Some software authors and repositories, such as R packages listed
  on <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org">Bioconductor</a>, quote
  specific citations that they ask people to use.  Some journals are
  requesting software to be submitted along with papers, and archiving
  that software.
  <a href="https://impactstory.org">ImpactStory</a> has plans to mine
  publication repositories for software references<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>,
  and organizations like <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#">Sage
  Synapse</a>, the <a href="https://osf.io">Open Science
  Framework</a>, and <a href="http://www.myexperiment.org">MyExperiment</a>
  are offering ways of storing a paper's software along with data in
  order to make research more replicable.
</p>
<p>
  From the perspective of the scientist actually trying to get work
  done, there's the problem of keeping track of all the software one
  is making use of, and getting that information both to the
  publishers of our papers, as well as back to the authors of the
  software, who desperately need evidence that it's being used.
  That's the part of the problem our group at Carnegie Mellon and UT
  Austin (<a href="http://herbsleb.org">Jim
  Herbsleb</a>, <a href="http://james.howison.name/">James
  Howison</a>, and <a href="http://chris.bogarthome.net/">myself</a>)
  have been working on.
</p>
<p>
  We are building a tool for monitoring actual usage of scientific
  software "in the wild", and we're looking for volunteers willing to
  let us capture your usage data (an anonymous list of packages you
  used in each session).  We're asking for users of the R language who
  are willing to install our scimapClient package, which collects
  anonymous information about which packages you used.  The data is
  fed into an online repository,
  <a href="http://scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu">http://scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu</a>,
  where you can browse the growing data set.
</p>
<p>
  We're just beginning to collect R data now, but we've examined
  analogous data an easier-to-collect source: scientific software run
  on a supercomputer.  Folks at the Texas Advanced Computing Center
  (TACC) have let us analyze a year's worth worth of
  data<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>, which you can explore
  on an alternate version of our website
  at <a href="http://scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu:7777">http://scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu:7777</a>.
</p>
<p>
  For example, in the supercomputer data, there's a dynamically loaded
  C++ library called Boost, which was loaded by a few different
  packages people used. We can see how often it was used over time,
  and what it was used with:
<p>
  <img src="{{site.filesurl}}/2015/02/boost-usage.png" alt="Boost Usage" />
</p>
<p>
  The big line chart shows usage of <code>boost</code> over time; a boost
  developer might use it to watch for trends, and compare usage
  against complementary or competing packages.
</p>
<p>
  The (inset) graph visualization uses size to represent number of
  jobs in which packages were used, and orange pie wedges to show the
  proportion of those jobs that used <code>boost</code>.  In this
  case, three packages: desmond, mpi, and gromacs, all
  used <code>boost</code>.  Gromacs, a molecular dynamics package, has
  a version of boost statically compiled in which isn't visible in our
  dataset, but it optionally
  <a href="http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Installation_Instructions">lets users link to this dynamic library</a>
  for better performance in some scenarios.  That occasional use of an
  external library is what we're seeing here.  A gromacs maintainer
  might use a visualization like the inset graph above to hypothesize
  that users were seldom taking advantage of this option, at least in
  the context of TACC.
</p>
<p>
  We believe there's great potential for this kind of analytical
  toolset, akin to what supercomputer operations centers use, but
  applied to the broader ecosystem of open software distributed across
  the laptops and desktops of the world's scientists.  If you're an R
  user who'd like to be a part of that, you can
  visit <a href="http://scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu/static/html/installR.html">our
  website</a> and follow the instructions to instrument your own R
  installation.

    Addendum:
    Andy Terrel pointed out on Twitter that after so many words on the topic,
    I didn't actually cite the software that was used to collect this data.
    Here are the main things we used:

    <li>
      The dynamically linked libraries were managed with a package called Lmod:
