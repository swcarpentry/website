<p>
  We are extremely pleased to announce that Data Carpentry has
  received $750,000 in funding from
  the <a href="http://moore.org">Gordon and Betty Moore
  Foundation</a>.
</p>

<p>
  With more than $6.4 billion in assets, the Gordon and Betty Moore
  Foundation is the ninth largest foundation in the United States. The
  Science Program accounts for approximately 40 percent of the
  foundation's annual grant making, making the foundation one of the
  largest private funders of science nationwide.
</p>
<p>
  Data Carpentry is fiscally sponsored project
  of <a href="http://numfocus.org">NumFOCUS</a>, a 501(c)3 non-profit
  organization.  We develop and provide training to researchers in
  fundamental data skills to enable more effective and efficient
  research progress.
</p>
<p>
  This grant will help support the project for two years. It will
  allow us to grow our core team, establish better infrastructure,
  work with the volunteer community to develop content, conduct more
  workshops in more scientific domains and plan for sustainability.
</p>
<p>
  The text of our grant proposal is
  available <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1507552">on
  Figshare</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We are particularly excited to work with the Moore Foundation with
  whom we share a mission of enabling data-driven discovery. Our focus
  is providing training that will help engage a larger population of
  scientists in
  tackling <a href="https://www.moore.org/programs/science/data-driven-discovery/ddd-practices">data-driven
  challenges</a>. Although petabytes of data are now available, the
  missing step between data collection and research progress is a lack
  of training for scientists in crucial skills for effectively
  managing and analyzing large amounts of data.
</p>
<p>
  Our goal is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific
  training covering the full life cycle of data-driven research. The
  focus of our activities on this grant will be:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Expanding into new domains:</em> We will develop lesson
    content in new domains, particularly in the life sciences and
    physical sciences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Train thousands of scientists:</em> We will run regular
    workshops at universities and research organizations, teaching
    scientists the skills they need to conduct research using large
    scale data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Scale our instructor pool:</em> Teaching Data Carpentry to
    thousands of scientists, across an array of domains, will require
    us to significantly expand the pool of high quality
    instructors. In collaboration with Software Carpentry, we will
    train instructors in both evidence-based teaching practices and
    the specifics of teaching and delivering Data Carpentry
    workshops. This includes fostering and supporting the community of
    instructors through a friendly, open, and diverse online
    community.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Develop strategies for delivering workshops online</em> As
    part of efforts to scale up training, we will also work to develop
    approaches to delivering workshops online that include active
    participation and real-time feedback and assistance from
    instructors.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The success of Data Carpentry is the result of the amazing community
  that has worked as instructors, content developers, workshop hosts,
  learners and supporters, and we can't thank you enough for your
  contributions. We look forward to the opportunity to continue to
  empower researchers and enable research. We have more information
  and posts coming soon on how to be involved as an instructor, in
  developing content or hosting workshops, so stay posted!
