  We are close to releasing a new version of
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/python-novice-inflammation">our standard Python lesson</a>
  that uses Python 3 instead of Python 2.
  As soon as that's done,
  we're going to warm up <a href="{{site.github_url}}/python-novice-inflammation/issues/127">this discussion</a>
  about fixing that lesson.
  One new contribution to that is <a href="http://blog.byronjsmith.com/swc-python-lesson.html">this post</a> by Byron Smith
  about how he trimmed the existing lesson.
  If you have other experiences or comments,
  please add them to <a href="{{site.github_url}}/python-novice-inflammation/issues/127">this GitHub issue</a>
  so that we can make decisions in September about what to include in Version 5.4 in November.
