  This year's edition of
  <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015">Google Summer of Code</a> (GSoC)
  has now finished.
  We are very happy with the outcome of the work of the three students that
  worked under the <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a> umbrella that we helped to coordinate.

  The projects were:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://insertinterestingnamehere.github.io/posts/gsoc-concluding-thoughts.html">Cython API for DyND</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="http://piotr.banaszkiewicz.org/blog/2015/08/15/amy-update-6/">Enhance Amy, a workshop-management platform for Software Carpentry</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="http://juliaquantum.github.io/news/2015/08/GSoC2015-Wrap-up-and-Outlook">JuliaQuantum: Framework for solvers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are grateful for the work done by the projects' mentors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alexander Croy,</li>
  <li>Greg Wilson,</li>
  <li>Irwin Zaid,</li>
  <li>Mark Wiebe, and</li>
  <li>W. Trevor King.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also grateful to those that helped organizing GSoC, especially:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Carol Willing,</li>
  <li>Ethan White,</li>
  <li>Jason K. Moore, and</li>
  <li>Sheila Miguez.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We hope that the students continue involved with the communities they worked
  with during the summer and spreading the free/open source software.
  See you all again next year.
