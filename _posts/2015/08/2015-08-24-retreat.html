  The Mentoring sub-committee is planning a Virtual Instructors Retreat this
  fall. The goal of the event is to build community between instructors, as
  well as give us all a chance to practice our teaching and give and receive
  feedback from each other. This will be a day-long event where we meet in
  person with our local community, where possible, and remotely where meeting
  in person is not possible. World-wide, all groups will also interact with
  each other via internet conferencing for specific portions of the event.
</p>
<p>
  We want as many of our instructors as possible to be able to participate,
  so please help us to do this by filling out
  <a href="http://doodle.com/fwvctramkztdyapb">this Doodle poll</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Also, we are interested in your ideas about such an event. Please feel free
  to mail any ideas, comments or questions to
  <a href="mailto:mentoring@lists.software-carpentry.org">the Mentoring sub-committee</a>.
