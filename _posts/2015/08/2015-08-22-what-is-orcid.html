  Part of being a successful researcher lies in the ability to stand
  out from your peers, which can be done through making and being
  acknowledge for valuable and original contributions. Once
  acknowledged for one discovery this can then act as a springboard to
  allow your peers to identify your other scholarly contributions, or
  alternatively identify potential for future collaboration, or be
  used as a proof of your research skills when applying for further
  funding. In short, making your work and accomplishments known is
  crucial to success in academia.
</p>
<p>
  Yet whilst so many functions of the academic process hang on the
  concept of citations and as such the ability to identify the
  researchers behind a piece of work, the actual means of identifying
  a researcher is not without its problems. For example how to
  identify the discoveries and related work of a specific "John Smith"
  after coming across one of the author's particularly informative
  publications? How do we keep up to date with a researcher's
  publications if they change their name? How do we keep track of a
  successful researcher who works across a number of institutions over
  the course of their career or who engages in work across a range of
  disciplines?
</p>

<p>
  Thus arises a demand for researchers to be uniquely identifiable
  through the course of their careers, no matter what changes within
  their personal or professional lives. Perhaps the most popular
  solution to this problem is the <em>Open Researcher and Contributor ID</em>,
  otherwise known as ORCID. An ORCID is a 16 digit, persistent digital
  identifier that identifies a researcher and it is remarkably simple
  to acquire one: simply go along to the website
  at <a href="http://orcid.org/">http://orcid.org/</a> and
  provide your name and email address. This identifier can then be
  attached to all of your various scholarly works from publications or
  datasets (and anything else in-between and beyond!) to firmly
  identify you as a contributor to the work in question. And by using
  the notion of contributor ORCIDs have the flexibility to allow for
  numerous different roles in a work to be recorded, thus greatly
  increasing the scope of works a researcher can affiliate themselves
  with. Once a researcher has a unique identifier, the problems
  describe above are resolved and it becomes almost trivial to follow
  a researchers progress throughout the course of their career which
  in turn makes it much easier for them to showcase their
  accomplishments.
</p>
<p>
  However, once a system of uniquely identifying researchers is
  embedded within the research ecosystem, a number of uses begin to
  emerge that extend the benefits beyond resolving the aforementioned
  issues, benefits that are enabled by the manner in which ORCID
  operates. ORCID itself is a non-profit organisation and thus it can
  offer an ORCID as a neutral identifier that allows different
  institutions' or publisher's own proprietary systems to interface
  with one another. As a result, different systems storing information
  about researchers can begin to build a much more comprehensive
  record of the research landscape, allowing them to consistently
  identify researchers who may not even have an identifier within the
  system in question.
</p>
<p>
  This feature of ORCID is perhaps best highlighted in ORCID's very
  own profile pages available at
  <a href="http://orcid.org/">http://orcid.org/</a> which
  presents users with a CV-like interface, providing a record of a
  researcher's education, employment, funding and works. One way in
  which to add a work to your ORCID profile is to import it from
  another site and in doing so it is possible to register your ORCID
  with the external organisation. For example, when I imported a paper
  from <a href="http://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a> using my
  ORCID I came across another paper I had been listed as co-author on
  which I didn't realise was online. By using the ORCID profile system
  in this way, it is therefore possible to build a single, consistent
  (and perhaps more comprehensive that one would initially image)
  record of one's research outcomes.
</p>
<p>
  Whilst the ORCID.org profiles are a useful feature that provide an
  overview of your research, they are ultimately a distraction from
  ORCID's power in it's ability to bring in all research contributions
  from a wide range of sources. When ORCID is combined with
  identifiers for other resources such as papers (identified by DOI's
  for example) and grants, the potential exists to illustrate a very
  informative and flexible image of a researcher's true impact in
  their community, that could be queried for a range of different
  purposes by different stakeholders. For example a researcher could
  use this dataset when applying for research grants, or a university
  may use it to demonstrate outreach work their academics have taken
  part in.
</p>
<p>
  The potential of ORCID is one that has many parallels with the
  potential of open linked data, but to properly achieve such benefits
  requires both a lot of work in developing tools that allow different
  systems to expose their data and to talk to one another, but also a
  high level of ORCID adoption. At the time of writing, ORCID claim to
  have 1,523,480 registered users, and this number is only likely to
  increase: ORCID is supported by a wide array of
  <a href="http://orcid.org/about/community/members">member organisations</a>
  including the <a href="https://orcid.soton.ac.uk/">University of
  Southampton</a>, many of which are actively encouraging people
  to sign up for ORCIDs and some research councils are considering
  mandating researchers have an ORCID as a condition on rewarding
  grants.
</p>
<p>
  It becomes clear then that ORCIDs are a potentially useful and
  powerful tool for the academic community. Having been devised to
  tackle some important, but perhaps unexciting issues facing around
  the way in which we disseminate research, all new opportunities
  arise that illustrate a potential to revolutionise the way in which
  we communicate our contributions. And whilst much of this potential
  is still yet to be realised, through increased adoption of ORCIDs
  and a better understanding of the role of good software in research,
  it is perhaps only a matter of time before everyone has their own
  ORCID.
