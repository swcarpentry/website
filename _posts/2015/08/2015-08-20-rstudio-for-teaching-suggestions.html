  On Twitter,
  the RStudio support team <a href="https://twitter.com/rstudiosupport/status/634397249452138496">requested suggestions for how to make RStudio better as a teaching tool</a>.
  So I've started an <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/communities/public/questions/205341007-Ideas-to-improve-RStudio-as-a-teaching-tool">issue on their support site</a> for instructors to chime in with ideas.
  Go ahead and let them know what would make teaching with RStudio easier and better!
