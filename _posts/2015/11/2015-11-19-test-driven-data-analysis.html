  My former colleague Nick Radcliffe has started posting a series of article
  on <a href="http://www.tdda.info/">test-driven data analysis</a>,
  in which he explores systematic ways of checking whether
  one-off data analyses are correct.
  It'll be really interesting to see how the series unfolds,
  and comments on the posts would be very welcome.
