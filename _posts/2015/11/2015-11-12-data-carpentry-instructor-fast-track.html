<p>
  Data Carpentry has been growing over the last year, and now with the
  addition of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2015/11/introducing_maneesha.html">Maneesha Sane</a>
  as Program Coordinator, we have the chance
  to run even more workshops in more domains. To date, we have used
  some great instructors from the Software Carpentry community as
  teachers; what we would like to do now is put that on a more regular
  footing.
</p>
<p>
  We want to update the instructor records to see who’s interested and
  qualified to teach Data Carpentry, so we’ve created
  a <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/fasttrack/">Data Carpentry
  Instructor FastTrack</a> certification. If you have already taught a
  Data Carpentry workshop, you’re registered as a Data Carpentry
  instructor and don’t need to go through the FastTrack certification
  process. If you are currently a Software Carpentry instructor and
  would like to teach core data wrangling skills to people who are new
  to computing, this program is for you!
</p>

<p>
  This program is just for people who are already Software Carpentry
  instructors. The Software Carpentry Foundation will continue to
  train new instructors, and we’re working together on the pathways to
  becoming both Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructors. If
  you’re going through Instructor Training right now or in the future,
  we’ll make sure you know how to become a Data Carpentry instructor.
</p>
<p>
  To become a Data Carpentry instructor through the FastTrack program, you should have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Demonstrated teaching experience for Software Carpentry or with
      another organization or university
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enough knowledge to teach at least two of our core topics
      (introductions to data organization, R, Python, SQL, or
      OpenRefine)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Demonstrated interest and ability to teach people new to
      computing
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you are interested and meet these requirements, please apply
  through <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/fasttrack/">the
  Data Carpentry website</a>.
