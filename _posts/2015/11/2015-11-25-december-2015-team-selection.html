Many of you who applied for instructor training in December are undoubtedly
receiving disappointing news. We had 250 applicants on 45 teams from a wide
range of locations. I'd like to talk through a few things about this process and
how it played out as I think it will help the community understand the situation
we were in with instructor training demand and our ability to meet demand.

Instructor training and consistency in instructor training is a major key to our
success and as we seek to scale this training there will be some bumps in the
road. The secret, if there is one, to Software Carpentry is the pedagogical
approach including tricks and tips for self-reflective teaching that we convey
to instructors and continue to advance as a community. For that training to be
successful and impactful we have limits to how many people we can train, we are
starting to fix that, see below. Bear with us, as with any small organization
with pressure to grow, we're finding our way. Community feedback is the essence
of what will keep us innovative and relevant to the needs of the scientists
around the world, so we welcome feedback, negative and positive on this or any
process we use in the Software Carpentry Community.
</p>
<p>
The intent of this process was for testing an online instructor training method
that will enable us to meet the pent-up demand for instructors by teaching a
focused online training in a shorter period of time (2-days). We simply don't
know if this method will work well at scale, so it is a community experiment. In
our in-person instructor trainings for member organizations we use breakouts of
of 2-3 person groups where students video each other teaching and reflect on the
video seeking to give honest feedback and find ways to improve their approach
and methods. This has been an immensely valuable part of our recent cohorts of
in-person trainers. We're trying to duplicate that online, and it has been a
bumpy road.
</p>
<p>
In the past, as you may know we've taught instructor training over 9-18 weeks.
This drawn-out process has been good for some, but the completion rate of
instructors at the end has been abysmal. This is why we've tried to reboot
online training in a two-day form. In conjunction with this we're moving from
Greg Wilson doing all of the instruction to a new team of instructor trainers.
These new trainers are teaching for the first time in this round and our hope is
that they will begin to remove the log-jam of instructor training demand
throughout 2016.
</p>
<p>
For this round our process for selection was that 19 community members from the
mentoring sub-committee, steering committee and administration were invited to
vote on the applications. Teams receiving the most votes were matched with
instructors in nearby timezones as possible. We limited the number of teams any
one instructor trainer would have to teach to 3. We're new at this and we simply
don't know what will and will not work at this scale.
</p>
<p>
Applications came from 45 teams comprised of 226 individuals. In the end were
able to select 9 teams from four continents. The number of people that applied
for this training is about 50% of our entire existing instructor corps of 450!
We're having some growing pains, and I am sorry we can not immediately meet all
team's needs.
</p>
<p>
I hope you understand the hard place we're in and I also hope we can have all of
the teams come to a training soon!
