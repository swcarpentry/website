  <a href="{{page.ropensci}}">rOpenSci</a>, whose mission is to
  develop and maintain sustainable software tools that allow
  researchers to access, visualize, document, and publish open data on
  the Web, is pleased to announce that it has been awarded a grant of
  nearly $2.9 million over three years
  from <a href="http://helmsleytrust.org/">The Leona M. and Harry
  B. Helmsley Charitable Trust</a>. The grant, which was awarded
  through the
  Trust's <a href="http://helmsleytrust.org/programs/health-biomedical-research-infrastructure">Biomedical
  Research Infrastructure Program</a>, will be used to expand
  rOpenSci's mission of developing tools and community around open
  data and reproducible research practices.

<p>
  <a href="{{page.ropensci}}">rOpenSci</a> is a project at the
  University of California, Berkeley that began a little over three
  years ago as a small collaboration among a few researchers who
  intended to package data-retrieval scripts. The founders wanted the
  data underlying their analysis to be open and easily accessible to
  everyone. The project has since grown into a widely recognized
  worldwide collaborative effort that plays an important role in
  fostering open and transparent scientific practices across the
  research community. rOpenSci supports an ecosystem of more than 50
  software packages, engages scores of collaborators from nearly two
  dozen countries, and has conducted dozens of workshops worldwide.
</p>
<p>
  The rOpenSci team has improved tools for researchers who consume
  open data and work closely with scientists to help them develop
  research software. In addition, the project has fostered a thriving
  community of researchers who develop software through open peer
  review and conferences.
</p>
<p>
  Funding from the Helmsley Charitable Trust will allow the rOpenSci
  team to develop new tools that support various pieces of the
  reproducible research workflow as the team continues to maintain the
  existing rOpenSci suite of software. The rOpenSci team is also
  planning a partnership with
  <a href="http://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a> that will
  allow DC to run rOpenSci-themed workshops (lessons taught with an
  emphasis on rOpenSci tools for data sharing, acquisition, retrieval,
  and visualization). Over the course of this partnership, the team
  hopes to develop a comprehensive corpus of openly licensed teaching
  material to be used at two-day workshops, as part of classroom
  curriculum, or for self-guided learning. These new training
  activities will provide the project with a comprehensive set of
  community resources, including lessons and tutorials.
</p>
<p>
  To scale up efforts in all of these areas, rOpenSci will be
  expanding its team over the coming months. New job postings,
  including those for a community manager, software engineer, and
  postdoctoral fellow, among various other short-term positions, will
  be posted on rOpenSci's website. Over the coming months, rOpenSci
  will also announce details of a new fellowship program.
