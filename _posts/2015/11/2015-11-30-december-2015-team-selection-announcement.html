Thank you to all the teams that applied for instructor training
that sent us applications.
Selection of the teams was a very difficult tasks because
</p>
<ul>
    <li>the applications were excellent, </li>
    <li>we had a small amount of time to discuss all the applications and</li>
    <li>we need to improve capacity to support the demand we see for instructor training.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The mentoring subcommittee has selected the teams that inform at their cover
letters that booked a room for the instructor training at
</p>

<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>We had applications from 44 teams and we could accommodate 12 total teams
that will be trained by
Christina Koch,
Fiona Tweedie,
Greg Wilson and
Steve Crouch.

<p>
More than half of the applications came from the US.
</p>
</p>
Canada is the country with the highest number of accepted teams
because we received application from three very small teams in close proximity
that we merged into one.
</p>
<p>
In terms of individual applicants,
the teams were comprised of more than 200 people
and we accepted 49 to the instructor training in December.

<h3>Source code and data</h3>
<p>
The source code for the plots are available
<a href="{{site.filesurl}}/2015/11/december-2015-team-selection-announcement.ipynb">here as a Jupyter Notebook</a>
and the CSV files used on it are available
<a href="{{site.filesurl}}/2015/11/group-applications.csv">here</a>
and <a href="{{site.filesurl}}/2015/11/individual-applications.csv">here</a>.
Both CSV files are a copy of the applications that we received
<strong>without</strong> names because of privacy concerns.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> We forgot to ask the gender to applicants
so the numbers in the CSV is just a guess based on their names.
