  The R Foundation
  recently <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2015/000591.html">announced</a>
  that all conferences it supports must have a code of conduct. They encourage
  other R meetings to adopt codes of conduct as well, stating that:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    A code of conduct serves two important purposes. Firstly, it sends a clear
    message to those outside the community that an R conference is a
    professional and comfortable working environment for all participants.
    Secondly, it provides a mechanism for reporting and monitoring any incidents
    of harassment that may occur.
  </p>

<p>
  The R Foundation has opted not to require a specific format for the code of
  conduct, but they point
  to <a href="http://user2015.math.aau.dk/behaviouR">useR! 2015's code</a> as
  one example. Acknowledging that a written code of conduct is insufficient
  without enforcement, the R Foundation has also stipulated that the codes of
  conduct should be legally and practically enforceable.
</p>

<p>
  This announcement came as welcome news to members of the R community who had
  requested such a policy. Last June many R users formalized this request in
  an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C1oPhup72lPHJXbpyJZNIo1BdCzfxZ_VoiWJWzmufjU/edit?usp=sharing">open
  letter to the R Foundation</a>.
</p>

<p>
  With its new policy, the R Foundation joins a growing number of academic and
  professional organizations
  (including <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/conduct.html">Software Carpentry</a>) that
  have instituted codes of conduct for all of their events. These policies are
  an important step in building inclusive and diverse communities, and it is
  rewarding to see the R Foundation respond positively to the voices of R users
  who want to make R conferences as safe and welcoming as possible.
