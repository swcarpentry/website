  Back when I was still trying to do science myself,
  my field of study was software engineering.
  The International Conference on Software Engineering is the big gathering for researchers in that area,
  and <a href="http://2015.icse-conferences.org/">this year's</a> has just wrapped up.
  Thanks to <a href="https://gist.github.com/mhoye/99b10089cb53a038c942">this Gist</a>
  from <a href="http://exple.tive.org/blarg/">Mike Hoye</a>,
  I was able to browse the papers presented at ICSE and co-located workshops
  (like him, I'm outside the Great Paywall of Academia),
  and I've included titles and abstracts below
  from the ones I think readers of this blog might enjoy.
  They're only a fraction of what was presented,
  and I freely admit the sample is biased toward the things I understand and find interesting,
  but I hope they'll convince you that
  people are doing solid empirical studies in software engineering,
  and producing insights that we can and should act on.
</p>
<p>
  Note: just over half of these papers (13 of 24) had an easily-findable version online.
  I'm not going to do the experiment,
  but I confidently predict that those 13 will be more widely read,
  and more influential,
  than the other 11.

  <dd>
    <p>
      How can organizational factors such as structure and culture
      have an impact on the working conditions of developers?  This
      study is based on ten months of observation of an in-house
      software development project within a large telecommunications
      company.  The observation was conducted during mandatory weekly
      status meetings, where technical and managerial issues were
      raised and discussed.  Preliminary results show that many
      decisions made under the pressure of certain organizational
      factors negatively affected software quality. This paper
      describes cases depicting the complexity of organizational
      factors and reports on ten issues that have had a negative
      impact on quality, followed by suggested avenues for corrective
      action.

  <dt>Chowdhury and Hindle: Mining StackOverflow to Filter out Off-topic IRC Discussion</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a commonly used
      tool by OpenSource developers. Developers use IRC channels
      to discuss programming related problems, but much of the
      discussion is irrelevant and off-topic. Essentially if we treat IRC
      discussions like email messages, and apply spam filtering, we can
      try to filter out the spam (the off-topic discussions) from the ham
      (the programming discussions). Yet we need labelled data that
      unfortunately takes time to curate.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid costly curration in order to filter out off-topic
      discussions, we need positive and negative data-sources. On-
      line discussion forums, such as StackOverflow, are very effective
      for solving programming problems. By engaging in open-data,
      StackOverflow data becomes a powerful source of labelled text
      regarding programming. This work shows that we can train
      classifiers using StackOverflow posts as positive examples of
      on-topic programming discussion. YouTube video comments,
      notorious for their lack of quality, serve as training set of off-
      topic discussion. By exploiting these datasets, accurate classifiers
      can be built, tested and evaluated that require very little effort
      for end-users to deploy and exploit.

  <dt>Labuschagne and Holmes: <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~rtholmes/papers/msr_2015_labuschagne.pdf">Do Onboarding Programs Work?</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Open source software systems rely on community source code
      contributions to fix bugs and develop new features.
      Unfortunately, it is often difficult to become an effective
      contributor on open-source projects due to the complexity of the
      tools required to develop and test new patches and the challenge
      of breaking into an already-formed social organization.  To help
      new contributors learn their development practices, OSS projects
      have created onboarding programs that, for example, identify
      easy 'first bugs' and mentor new developers' contributions.
      However, we found that developers who join an organization
      through these programs are half as likely to transition into
      long-term community members than developers who do not use these
      programs. Measuring the impact of these programs is important,
      as coordinating and staffing onboarding projects is
      expensive. This paper examines onboarding programs employed by
      Mozilla and demonstrates that they are not as effective at
      transitioning new developers into long-term contributors as
      might be hoped, although developers who do succeed through these
      programs find them valuable.

  <dt>Bosu, Greiler, and Bird: Characteristics of Useful Code Reviews: An Empirical Study at Microsoft</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Over the past decade, both open source and commercial software
      projects have adopted contemporary peer code review practices as
      a quality control mechanism. Prior research has shown that
      developers spend a large amount of time and effort performing
      code reviews. Therefore, identifying factors that lead to useful
      code reviews can benefit projects by increasing code review
      effectiveness and quality. In a three-stage mixed research
      study, we qualitatively investigated what aspects of code
      reviews make them useful to developers, used our findings to
      build and verify a classification model that can distinguish
      between useful and not useful code review feedback, and finally
      we used this classifier to classify review comments enabling us
      to empirically investigate factors that lead to more effective
      code review feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      In total, we analyzed 1.5 millions review comments from five
      Microsoft projects and uncovered many factors that affect the
      usefulness of review feedback. For example, we found that the
      proportion of useful comments made by a reviewer increases
      dramatically in the first year that he or she is at Microsoft
      but tends to plateau afterwards. In contrast, we found that the
      more files that are in a change, the lower the proportion of
      comments in the code review that will be of value to the author
      of the change. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations
      for practitioners to improve effectiveness of code reviews.

  <dt>Jbara and Feitelson: <a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~feit/papers/RegEye15ICPC.pdf">How Programmers Read Regular Code: A Controlled Experiment Using Eye Tracking</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Regular code, which includes repetitions of the same basic
      pattern, has been shown to have an effect on code comprehension:
      a regular function can be just as easy to comprehend as an
      irregular one with the same functionality, despite being longer
      and including more control constructs. It has been speculated
      that this effect is due to leveraging the understanding of the
      first instances to ease the understanding of repeated instances
      of the pattern. To verify and quantify this effect, we use eye
      tracking to measure the time and effort spent reading and
      understanding regular code. The results are that time and effort
      invested in the initial code segments are indeed much larger
      than those spent on the later ones, and the decay in effort can
      be modeled by an exponential or cubic model. This shows that
      syntactic code complexity metrics (such as LOC and MCC) need to
      be made context-sensitive, e.g. by giving reduced weight to
      repeated segments according to their place in the sequence.

  <dd>
    <p>
      Micro-clones are tiny duplicated pieces of code; they typically
      comprise only a few statements or lines. In this paper, we
      expose the "last line effect," the phenomenon that the last line
      or statement in a micro-clone is much more likely to contain an
      error than the previous lines or statements. We do this by
      analyzing 208 open source projects and reporting on 202 faulty
      micro-clones.

    <p>
      <em>
	From the body of the paper: In total, our findings confirm the
	presence of a strong last line and last statement effect,
	accepting both RQ1 and RQ2.  We assume the effect to be caused
	by and large through copy- and-pasting code, and that
	developers have a psychological tendency to think changes of
	similar code blocks are finished earlier than they really
	are. This way, they miss one critical last modification.

  <dt>Martin, Cordy, Adams, and Antoniol: Make It Simple &ndash; An Empirical Analysis of GNU Make Feature Use in Open Source Projects</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Make is one of the oldest build technologies and is still widely
      used today, whether by manually writing Makefiles, or by
      generating them using tools like Autotools and CMake.  Despite
      its conceptual simplicity, modern Make implementations such as
      GNU Make have become very complex languages, featuring
      functions, macros, lazy variable assignments and (in GNU Make
      4.0) the Guile embedded scripting language. Since we are
      interested in understanding how widespread such complex language
      features are, this paper studies the use of Make features in
      almost 20,000 Makefiles, comprised of over 8.4 million lines,
      from more than 350 different open source projects. We look at
      the popularity of features and the difference between
      hand-written Makefiles and those generated using various
      tools. We find that generated Makefiles use only a core set of
      features and that more advanced features (such as function
      calls) are used very little, and almost exclusively in
      hand-written Makefiles.

  <dt>MacLeod, Storey, and Bergen: Code, Camera, Action: How Software Developers Document and Share Program Knowledge Using YouTube</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Creating documentation is a challenging task in software
      engineering and most techniques involve the laborious and
      sometimes tedious job of writing text. This paper explores an
      alternative to traditional text-based documentation, the
      screencast, which captures a developer's screen while they
      narrate how a program or software tool works.  We conducted a
      study to investigate how developers produce and share
      developer-focused screencasts using the YouTube social
      platform. First, we identified and analyzed a set of development
      screencasts to determine how developers have adapted to the
      medium to meet the demands of development-related documentation
      needs. We also explored the techniques and strategies used for
      sharing software knowledge.  Second, we interviewed screencast
      producers to understand their motivations for creating
      screencasts, and to uncover the perceived benefits and
      challenges in producing code-focused videos.  Our findings
      reveal that video is a useful medium for communicating program
      knowledge between developers, and that developers build their
      online personas and reputation by sharing videos through social
      channels.

  <dd>
    <p>
      An effective way to learn about software development tools is by
      directly observing peers' workflows.  However, these tool
      knowledge transfer events happen infrequently because developers
      must be both colocated and available. We explore an online
      social screencasting system that removes the dependencies of
      colocation and availability while maintaining the beneficial
      tool knowledge transfer of peer observation .  Our results from
      a formative study indicate these online observations happen more
      frequently than in-person observations, but their effects are
      only temporary.  We conclude that while peer observation
      facilitates online knowledge transfer, it is not the only
      component &ndash; other social factors may be involved.

  <dt>Agrawal, Amreen, and Mockus: Commit Quality in Five High Performance Computing Projects</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      High Performance Computing (HPC) has a long history of software
      development but relatively little is known about the approaches
      this community uses to create and maintain software. To close
      this gap we study the practices of using version control tools
      in five HPC production projects. We also contrast these
      practices to practices used in three distinct non-HPC open
      source projects. We first obtain version history of the projects
      from SVN, Mercurial, and Git. We then clean and process the data
      and use published material to construct three measures of code
      commit quality: the fraction of unique commit comments, their
      size, and the number of files per commit. Our results indicate
      relatively high but declining commit quality, and relatively
      large commits in HPC projects. We expect this work to highlight
      the differences among different software engineering domains and
      may lead to ideas suggesting good practices of using software
      tools in these domains.

  <dt>Wang, Janjusic, Iversen, Thornton, Karssovski, Wu, and Xu: A Scientific Function Test Framework for Modular Environmental Model Development: Application to the Community Land Model</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      As environmental models have become more complicated, we need
      new tools to analyze and validate these models and to facilitate
      collaboration among field scientists, observation dataset
      providers, environmental system modelers, and computer
      scientists.  Modular design and function test of environmental
      models have gained attention recently within the Biological and
      Environmental Research Program of the U.S. Department of Energy.
      In this paper, we will present our methods and software tools 1)
      to analyze environmental software and 2) to generate modules for
      scientific function testing of environmental models.  We have
      applied these methods to the Community Land Model with three
      typical scenarios: 1) benchmark case function validation, 2)
      observation- constraint function validation, and 3) a virtual
      root module generation for root function investigation and
      evaluation. We believe that our strategies and experience in
      scientific function test framework can be beneficial to many
      other research programs that adapt integrated environmental
      modeling methodology.

  <dt>Hata, Todo, Onoue, and Matsumoto: Characteristics of Sustainable OSS Projects: A Theoretical and Empirical Study</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      How can we attract developers?  What can we do to incentivize
      developers to write code?  We started the study by introducing
      the population pyramid visualization to software development
      communities, called software population pyramids, and found a
      typical pattern in shapes. This pattern comes from the
      differences in attracting coding contributors and discussion
      contributors. To understand the causes of the differences, we
      then build game-theoretical models of the contribution
      situation. Based on these results, we again analyzed the
      projects empirically to support the outcome of the models, and
      found empirical evidence.  The answers to the initial questions
      are clear.  To incentivize developers to code, the projects
      should prepare documents, or the projects or third parties
      should hire developers, and these are what sustainable projects
      in GitHub did in reality.  In addition, making innovations to
      reduce the writing costs can also have an impact in attracting
      coding contributors.

  <dt>Kanij, Merkel, and Grundy: <a href="http://www.ict.swin.edu.au/personal/jgrundy/papers/chase2015.pdf">An Empirical Investigation of Personality Traits of Software Testers</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Software testing is the process of an execution-based
      investigation of some aspects of the software's quality.  The
      efficiency of the process depends on the methods and
      technologies used, but crucially also on the human testers.
      Software testers typically attempt to anticipate and expose ways
      software may be defective, a fundamentally different task set to
      those of other software development practitioners.  This raises
      the question of whether the personality of software testers may
      be different to other people involved in software development.
      To test this hypothesis, we collected personality profiles using
      the big five factor model of around 200 software development
      practitioners. Analysis of this data indicates that software
      testers are significantly higher on the conscientiousness factor
      than other software development practitioners, while other
      factors remain broadly consistent.

  <dt>Szabo: Novice Code Understanding Strategies During a Software Maintenance Assignment</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Existing efforts on teaching software maintenance have focussed
      on constructing adequate codebases that students with limited
      knowledge could maintain, with little focus on the learning
      outcomes of such exercises and of the approaches that students
      employ while performing maintenance.  An analysis of the code
      understanding strategies employed by novice students as they
      perform software maintenance exercises is fundamental for the
      effective teaching of software maintenance.  In this paper, we
      analyze the strategies employed by second year students in a
      maintenance exercise over a large codebase.  We analyze student
      reflections on their code understanding, maintenance process and
      the use of tools. We show that students are generally capable of
      working with large codebases.  Our study also finds that the
      majority of students follow a systematic approach to code
      understanding, but that their approach can be significantly
      improved through the use of tools and a better understanding of
      reverse engineering approaches.

  <dt>Falkner, Szabo, Vivian, and Falkner: Evolution of Software Development Strategies</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The development of discipline-specific cognitive and
      meta-cognitive skills is fundamental to the successful mastery
      of software development skills and processes.  This development
      happens over time and is influenced by many factors, however its
      understanding by teachers is crucial in order to develop
      activities and materials to transform students from novice to
      expert software engineers. In this paper, we analyse the
      evolution of learning strategies of novice, first year students,
      to expert, final year students.  We analyse reflections on
      software development processes from students in an introductory
      software development course, and compare them to those of final
      year students, in a distributed systems development course.  Our
      study shows that computer science - specific strategies evolve
      as expected, with the majority of final year students including
      design before coding in their software development process, but
      that several areas still require scaffolding activities to
      assist in learning development.

  <dd>
    <p>
      Because of its many uses and benefits, code reviews are a
      standard part of the modern software engineering workflow.
      Since they require involvement of people, code reviewing is
      often the longest part of the code integration activities. Using
      experience gained at Microsoft and with support of data, we
      posit (1) that code reviews often do not find functionality
      issues that should block a code submission; (2) that effective
      code reviews should be performed by people with specific set of
      skills; and (3)that the social aspect of code reviews cannot be
      ignored. We find that we need to be more sophisticated with our
      guidelines for the code review workflow.  We show how our
      findings from code reviewing practice influence our code review
      tools at Microsoft. Finally,we assert that, due to its costs,
      code reviewing practice is a topic deserving to be better
      understood, systematized and applied to software engineering
      workflow with more precision than the best practice currently
      prescribes.

  <dt>Zhou, Lou, Zhang, Lin, Lin, and Qin: An Empirical Study on Quality Issues of Production Big Data Platform</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Big Data computing platform has evolved to be a multi-tenant
      service. The service quality matters because system failure or
      performance slowdown could adversely affect business and user
      experience. To date, there is few study in literature on service
      quality issues of production Big Data computing platform.  In
      this paper, we present an empirical study on the service quality
      issues of Microsoft ProductA, which is a company-wide
      multi-tenant Big Data computing platform, serving thousands of
      customers from hundreds of teams. ProductA has a well-defined
      escalation process (i.e., incident management process), which
      helps customers report service quality issues on 24/7 basis.
      This paper investigates the common symptom, causes and
      mitigation of service quality issues in Big Data platform.  We
      conduct a comprehensive empirical study on 210 real service
      quality issues of ProductA. Our major findings include (1) 21.0%
      of escalations are caused by hardware faults; (2) 36.2% are
      caused by system side defects; (3) 37.2% are due to customer
      side faults.  We also studied the general diagnosis process and
      the commonly adopted mitigation solutions. Our study results
      provide valuable guidance on improving existing development and
      maintenance practice of production Big Data platform, and
      motivate tool support.

  <dd>
    <p>
      Spreadsheets are used extensively in business processes around
      the world and as such, are a topic of research interest. Over
      the past few years, many spreadsheet studies have been performed
      on the EUSES spreadsheet corpus. While this corpus has served
      the spreadsheet community well, the spreadsheets it contains are
      mainly gathered with search engines and might therefore not
      represent spreadsheets used in companies.  This paper presents
      an analysis of a new dataset, extracted from the Enron email
      archive, containing over 15,000 spreadsheets used within the
      Enron Corporation.  In addition to the spreadsheets, we also
      present an analysis of the associated emails, where we look into
      spreadsheet-specific email behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our analysis shows that 1) 24% of Enron spreadsheets with at
      least one formula contain an Excel error, 2) there is little
      diversity in the functions used in spreadsheets: 76% of
      spreadsheets in the presented corpus use the same 15 functions
      and, 3) the spreadsheets are substantially more smelly than the
      EUSES corpus, especially in terms of long calculation
      chains. Regarding the emails, we observe that spreadsheets 1)
      are a frequent topic of email conversation with 10% of emails
      either referring to or sending spreadsheets and 2) the emails
      are frequently discussing errors in and updates to spreadsheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
	Note: while some people are already citing this as "proof"
	that spreadsheets are bad, the more interesting question is
	whether they are <strong>worse</strong>: is the error rate of
	(for example) R programs written by people with the same
	formal training in data analysis skills higher, lower, or the
	same?  As far as I know, that study has yet to be done...

  <dt>Nanz and Furia: <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0252.pdf">A Comparative Study of Programming Languages in Rosetta Code</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Sometimes debates on programming languages are more religious
      than scientific. Questions about which language is more succinct
      or efficient, or makes developers more productive are discussed
      with fervor, and their answers are too often based on anecdotes
      and unsubstantiated beliefs. In this study, we use the largely
      untapped research potential of Rosetta Code, a code repository
      of solutions to common programming tasks in various languages,
      which offers a large data set for analysis. Our study is based
      on 7,087 solution programs corresponding to 745 tasks in 8
      widely used languages representing the major programming
      paradigms (procedural: C and Go; object-oriented: C# and Java;
      functional: F# and Haskell; scripting: Python and Ruby). Our
      statistical analysis reveals, most notably, that: functional and
      scripting languages are more concise than procedural and object-
      oriented languages; C is hard to beat when it comes to raw speed
      on large inputs, but performance differences over inputs of
      moderate size are less pronounced and allow even interpreted
      languages to be competitive; compiled strongly-typed languages,
      where more defects can be caught at compile time, are less prone
      to runtime failures than interpreted or weakly-typed languages.
      We discuss implications of these results for developers,
      language designers, and educators.

  <dd>
    <p>
      Asserts have long been a strongly recommended (if
      non-functional) adjunct to programs. They certainly don't add
      any user-evident feature value; and it can take quite some skill
      and effort to devise and add useful asserts. However, they are
      believed to add considerable value to the developer. Certainly,
      they can help with automated verification; but even in the
      absence of that, claimed advantages include improved
      understandability, maintainability, easier fault localization
      and diagnosis, all eventually leading to better software
      quality. We focus on this latter claim, and use a large dataset
      of asserts in C and C++ programs to explore the connection
      between asserts and defect occurrence.  Our data suggests a
      connection: functions with asserts do have significantly fewer
      defects. This indicates that asserts do play an important role
      in software quality; we therefore explored further the factors
      that play a role in assertion placement: specifically, process
      factors (such as developer experience and ownership) and product
      factors , particularly interprocedural factors, exploring how
      the placement of assertions in functions are influenced by local
      and global network properties of the callgraph. Finally, we also
      conduct a differential analysis of assertion use across
      different application domains.

  <dt>Salman, Misirli, and Juristo: Are Students Representatives of Professionals in Software Engineering Experiments?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Most of the experiments in software engineering employ students
      as subjects.  This raises concerns about the realism of the
      results acquired through students and adaptability of the
      results to software industry.  <em>Aim:</em> We compare students
      and professionals to understand how well students represent
      professionals as experimental subjects in SE
      research. <em>Method:</em> The comparison was made in the
      context of two test-driven development experiments conducted
      with students in an academic setting and with professionals in a
      software organization. We measured the code quality of several
      tasks implemented by both subject groups and checked whether
      students and professionals perform similarly in terms of code
      quality metrics.  <em>Results:</em> Except for minor
      differences, neither of the subject groups is better than the
      other. Professionals produce larger, yet less complex, methods
      when they use their traditional development approach, whereas
      both subject groups perform similarly when they apply a new
      approach for the first time.  <em>Conclusion:</em> Given a
      carefully scoped experiment on a development approach that is
      new to both students and professionals, similar performances are
      observed.  Further investigation is necessary to analyze the
      effects of subject demographics and level of experience on the
      results of SE experiments.

  <dd>
    <p>
      In past and recent years, the issues related to managing
      technical debt received significant attention by researchers
      from both industry and academia. There are several factors that
      contribute to technical debt. One of these is represented by
      code bad smells, i.e., symptoms of poor design and
      implementation choices.  While the repercussions of smells on
      code quality have been empirically assessed, there is still only
      anecdotal evidence on when and why bad smells are introduced.
      To fill this gap, we conducted a large empirical study over the
      change history of 200 open source projects from different
      software ecosystems and investigated when bad smells are
      introduced by developers, and the circumstances and reasons
      behind their introduction.  Our study required the development
      of a strategy to identify smell-introducing commits, the mining
      of over 0.5M commits, and the manual analysis of 9,164 of them
      (i.e., those identified as smell-introducing).  Our findings
      mostly contradict common wisdom stating that smells are being
      introduced during evolutionary tasks.  In the light of our
      results, we also call for the need to develop a new generation
      of recommendation systems aimed at properly planning smell
      refactoring activities.

  <dd>
    <p>
      Developers sometimes take the initiative to build tools to solve
      problems they face. What motivates developers to build these
      tools? What is the value for a company? Are the tools built
      useful for anyone besides their creator? We conducted a
      qualitative study of toolbuilding, adoption, and impact within
      Microsoft. This paper presents our findings on the extrinsic and
      intrinsic factors linked to toolbuilding, the value of building
      tools, and the factors associated with tool spread. We find that
      the majority of developers build tools. While most tools never
      spread beyond their creator's team, most have more than one
      user, and many have more than one collaborator.  Organizational
      cultures that are receptive towards toolbuilding produce more
      tools, and more collaboration on tools. When nurtured and
      spread, homegrown tools have the potential to create significant
      impact on organizations.

  <dd>
    <p>
      In the pull-based development model, the integrator has the
      crucial role of managing and integrating contributions.  This
      work focuses on the role of the integrator and investigates
      working habits and challenges alike.  We set up an exploratory
      qualitative study involving a large-scale survey of 749
      integrators, to which we add quantitative data from the
      integrator's project.  Our results provide insights into the
      factors they consider in their decision making process to accept
      or reject a contribution.  Our key findings are that integrators
      struggle to maintain the quality of their projects and have
      difficulties with prioritizing contributions that are to be
      merged.  Our insights have implications for practitioners who
      wish to use or improve their pull-based development process, as
      well as for researchers striving to understand the theoretical
      implications of the pull-based model in software development.
