  The assessment subcommittee seeks to assess the effectiveness of the
  activities of the Software Carpentry Foundation (SCF).  It
  met
  <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/subcommittees/assessment/minutes-2015-05-04.md">a few weeks ago</a>
  and drafted an action plan on how to move forward
  to create a series of assessments for our learners.
  This action plan will be the basis on how further assessment tools
  will be developed.

<p>
  We've created a
  <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/assessment">repository</a>
  and opened a few
  <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/assessment/issues">issues</a>
  to get the ball rolling for discussion.  The goal is to brainstorm a
  list of questions we want to ask our learners with respect to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>attitude/opinions/mindsets,</li>
  <li>facts/declarative knowledge, and</li>
  <li>actual, testable skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This will be an iterative process where the rest of the assessment
  committee (and anyone else who is interested) will add any number of
  questions that would be useful to assess our learners.  We will then
  refine the questions over a series of workshops and test for validity
  and reliability.
</p>
<p>
  Please head over to the
  <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/subcommittees/assessment/minutes-2015-05-04.md">meeting notes</a>,
  where we have a section on "Advice for writing questions".
</p>
<p>
  In addition to community input on potential questions we are also
  seeking feedback on how best to organize the issue board for
  discussion as more assessments are being developed.  We are
  considering using issue tags and/or naming conventions, since it seems
  like the first logical step, but are open to critiques.
  The goal is to use the summer workshops to refine the first assessment
  questionnaire so we can start collecting data by the Fall.
