<p>
  Achintya Rao started a PhD last January,
  and in response to a request for advice from a friend,
  wrote a <a href="https://raoofphysics.github.io/phd-starter-kit/">PhD Starter Kit</a>
  that lists useful tools and practices.
  Most of them involve software of one kind or another,
  and it's interesting to compare the list to what we teach:
  if nothing else,
  it tells me that we really do need to figure out what to teach people
  about publishing science in the 21st Century.
