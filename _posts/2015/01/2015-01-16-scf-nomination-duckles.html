  Hi, I'm <a href="http://jduck.net/cv">Jonah Duckles</a>, I have been
  active in teaching Software Carpentry workshops (seven so far) and
  have found a joy in teaching and learning this curriculum that has
  made me passionate about the mission of the organization. In my job,
  I work to spread knowledge, skills and competency in wide ranging
  areas of scholarly computing. Serving on the Software Carpentry
  Steering Committee would be a natural extension of my current job,
  dovetailing well into my current responsibilities and I'm excited to
  be considered.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  At the University of Oklahoma, my job is to help researchers by
  removing friction points in their data-slinging workflows. This is
  not necessarily about computing performance, but finding the
  appropriate computing tools for the task at hand. First we embed
  with research teams to understand their research and sticking
  points. At the same time we survey the existing tool space to
  understand hardware and software environments available in the open
  source and commercial spaces seeking to understand how they might be
  applied to research goals. Then we work to marry available tools and
  techniques toward solving researcher's challenges.
</p>
<p>
  I see the work of Software Carpentry as being able to catalyze
  research through skills development, accelerating scientific inquiry
  with the appropriate application of tools to problems. Software
  Carpentry has formalized the way I think about how to best deliver
  an understanding of complex technical tools to scientists with
  widely varied backgrounds and experience. I find myself most
  passionate and engaged when working across disciplines and within
  groups that are solving complex problems. Software Carpentry is a
  key tool for scientists to be able to solve those problems.
</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
  Software Carpentry is a great introduction for scientists. Along
  with the core work of the committee, I'd like to work to champion
  the expansion and support of our community in two key
  ways:
</p>
<h3>1. Community building for institutions post workshop</h3>
<p>
  I'd like to survey past workshop organizers and learners to
  understand what works and doesn't work in their attempts to sustain
  momentum of workshops and continuing to develop skills. It can be
  tricky to keep the momentum going, and I'm convinced it is about
  building and sustaining local communities in departments and lab
  groups that can share and advance their skills together. I would
  work to identify successful methods of sustaining and expanding
  skills and expertise for learners and pilot those programs for
  groups.
</p>
<h3>2. International expansion</h3>
<p>
  Expanding the network of instructors and workshops to even more
  international locations would help to make this a worldwide
  movement. These skills are important to 21st century scientific
  problem solving and I'd like to strive to spread them as far as
  possible. I will work to identify and seek funding opportunities on
  behalf of the Foundation and its partners that would enable our
  instructor corps to teach workshops and train instructors in lesser
  served places around the world. We'd also work to identify language
  teams that can own and manage course material in the most common
  native-languages of the world. Then lay out a vision and plan for
  non-english course material to be updated and expanded in the
  future.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you for your consideration. I am passionate about the mission
  of the Software Carpentry Foundation and I hope to continue to
  instruct and serve The Software Carpentry Foundation in many ways,
  both formal and informal in the future.
