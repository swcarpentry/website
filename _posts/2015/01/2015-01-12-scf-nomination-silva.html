  A year and a half ago I read the
  <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/06/14/5992/">announcement of the Mozilla Science Lab</a>
  by Mark Surman
  and that way I discovered Software Carpentry.
  Months later,
  I was participating in the
  <a href="{{site.training_url}}/2013/08/18/round-6-1-concept-maps/">6th round of Instructor Training</a>,
  and since then I have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>taught at all 6 workshops held in Brazil,</li>
  <li>improved the lessons and helped new instructors do so too,</li>
  <li>suggested changes to the new layout of our lessons and helped in the transition, and</li>
  <li>publicized Software Carpentry.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Volunteering with Software Carpentry is one of the things that I'm really
  proud of doing and I'd be honored be a member of the SCF Steering Committee.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
  I'm almost sure that I'm the youngest member applying for the Steering
  Committee and because of it I didn't have amazing things to say about myself. I'm
  finishing my Bachelor in Apply Mathematics at the University of Campinas after
  trying and failing to get some undergraduate and graduate colleagues to adopt better
  research practices like
  scripting their data analyses <strong>in whatever tool they prefer</strong> instead of
  write down on paper <strong>by hand</strong> all the
  steps needed for analysing the effect of changes in a linear programming problem
  solver.
</p>
<h3>Commitment</h3>
<p>
  As a member of the SCF Steering Committee I'd like to focus
  on increasing our activities in Latin America, specially Brazil, by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Running at least as many workshops as we did last year in Brazil.</strong>
    Running workshops is one of the most important activities of Software
    Carpentry because is the way that we advertise ourself and draw new
    instructors.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Increase the number of instructors based on Brazil.</strong>
    To run more workshops in Brazil is vital that we have more instructors in
    Brazil (hopefully we will have
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/11/instructor-training-stats.html">three more instructors in Brazil</a>
    after the next online instructor training round).
    To be sincere I don't know how to do that but I believe that the Steering
    Committee can help me with that.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Translate the lessons to Portuguese.</strong>
    To spread our activities in Brazil we will need to translate our lessons to
    Portuguese. To do that we also need more instructors that speak Portuguese.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Find ways to support our activities in Brazil.</strong>
    We can't do all the things above
    without some type of financial support (e.g. air plane tickets and
    accommodations for instructors). So, if I was elected I will spend most of
    my time searching for grants and events that could support the cost of our
    workshops.
  </li>
</ul>
