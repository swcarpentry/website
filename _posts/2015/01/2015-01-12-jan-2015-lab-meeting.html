  We will hold our next online lab meeting at 11:00 and again at 19:00 Eastern time
  on Thursday, January 22, 2015.
  People who are standing for election will have a chance to talk about what they hope to do
  and to answer questions from other members,
  and we'll present updates on our finances
  and on our new workshop and lesson templates.
  If you're planning to attend,
  please add yourself to <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-labmeeting-2015-01">this Etherpad</a>.
  We look forward to seeing you then.
