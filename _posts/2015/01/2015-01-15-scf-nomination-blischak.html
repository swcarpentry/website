  I feel I would be a good addition to the Steering Committee of the
  Software Carpentry Foundation because 1) I am a scientist that had
  to learn programming on the job, just like our target audience, 2)
  my experience performing many roles within SWC, most importantly as
  the maintainer of the R lesson materials, and 3) my goal to increase
  the collaborative aspect of our lesson development process.

  I am currently a graduate student in genetics at the University of
  Chicago. I study the transcriptional response of immune cells to
  infection. This requires daily use of computational skills that are
  simply not taught to biologists (though this has certainly improved
  over the years). Using books and online resources, I was able to
  self-teach myself enough to be functional with the Unix Shell,
  Python, and R. The problem with this approach is that you can only
  self-teach yourself concepts that you know exists. This is why SWC
  is so important; scientists do not realize what they don't
  know. When I attended an SWC workshop back in April 2012, I had no
  expectation that they would be able to solve the growing problem I
  had: directories full of files like "analysis-1.R", "analysis-2.R",
  etc. Now that all the code I write is under version control, I can
  say that my experience with SWC truly changed how I worked as a
  scientist.

  After my positive experience as an attendee, I started getting more
  involved. First as an instructor, then lead instructor, and
  eventually I took on the role of unofficial R maintainer in February
  2014 (we didn't start having official subject maintainers until
  September). My biggest accomplishment as the R maintainer was
  organizing
  the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/announcing-novice-r-lessons.html">translation
  of the novice Python lesson to R</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Unsurprisingly, I learned firsthand how difficult it is to manage a
  group of collaborators to develop lesson material (and we weren't
  even starting from scratch!). I think we have lots of room for
  improvement for achieving our goal
  of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2011/12/fork-merge-and-share.html">producing
  open source teaching material</a> similar to how open source
  software is produced, especially now that we have overcome the
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/03/collaborative-lesson-development.html">bottleneck
  of having enough instructors familiar with version control</a>. The
  materials we currently have were each largely written by a single
  author, and then other contributors are only able to make small
  edits that do not affect the overall design of the
  lesson. Furthermore, many instructors still write custom lessons
  that specifically appeal to their audience, but then these do not
  get incorporated back into the main repository of lessons. To
  improve this process, I'd like to organize small groups of
  instructors from the same scientific field to develop lessons
  optimized for their field. This would increase the level of
  collaboration because multiple instructors would participate in the
  actual design of the lesson. And while the lessons would still teach
  the
  <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745">language-agnostic
  principles</a> that SWC promotes, each of the separate lessons could
  use data and vocabulary that will be familiar (and motivating!) to a
  target audience.
</p>
<p>
  If you like this vision of SWC lesson development, please vote for
  me in the upcoming election. And either way, I look forward to
  continuing working with the SWC community. See you on the mailing
  lists!
