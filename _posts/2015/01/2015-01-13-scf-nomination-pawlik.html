My first degree was in Computer Science. When I started the university I had very little idea about programming.
I struggled a lot. I graduated very discouraged and convinced that I just couldn't do it. But then eight years 
later Greg asked me if I'd like to be a Software Carpentry instructor. I finished the instructor training
and I realized that had I been taught differently, maybe now I'd have a great career as a software 
developer. But then, I wouldn't be writing this blog post.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p> 
My background is not in science but rather in studying scientific practice. In 2014 I completed
a PhD at the Open University in the UK.  The focus of my research was the practices around
writing, maintaining, and using scientific software documentation. This research gave me
insight into the everyday work of scientists developing software. Now I work at the University of
Manchester in the UK, in the <a href="http://software.ac.uk/">Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)</a> project. 
I lead the Institute's training activities which include coordinating Software Carpentry
workshops in Great Britain.   
</p>
<h3>Previous Involvement</h3>
<p>
I started with Software Carpentry as a helper, then became an instructor and taught 
for the first time at a workshop in April 2013. Today I have taught at over ten
workshops, mainly in the UK and US. I also co-organised and taught at two workshops
(including one for Women in Science and Engineering) in Poland, where I'm originally from. 
</p>
<p>
My work in SSI allowed me to get engaged in developing Software Carpentry in many aspects.
Along with my colleague Giacomo Peru, I have been providing
administrative and operational support for the workshops in the UK. I have also been 
promoting the Software Carpentry training model and have been advocating the need
for increasing the computational competence among researchers at all career levels. 
</p>
<p>
I am a part of the Steering Committee of Software Carpentry's sister organisation 
<a href="http://datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a>. Recently I co-organised
and taught at the first Data Carpentry workshop in the United Kingdom. 
And in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.elixir-europe.org/">ELIXIR project</a> 
I developed a preliminary plan to roll out Software and Data Carpentry across Europe
in partnership with the <a href="http://www.elixir-europe.org/about/elixir-nodes">ELIXIR Nodes</a>.
</p>
<h3>Future Contribution</h3>
<p>
If elected to the 2015 Steering Committee, I would,
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/01/scf-nomination-huff.html">like Katy Huff</a>,
be happy to take up any post. Based on my experience so far, I would be helping 
with coordination and organisation of Software Carpentry workshops in the UK, 
and across other European countries. I would try find out how to get Software Carpentry
to the parts of the world were we haven't been yet.  
</p>
<p>
I would contribute to the instructor training and to the development of the instructor handbook.
I had an opportunity to attend and help at three face-to-face instructors training sessions. I 
have also been helping out some less experienced instructors in the UK in setting up
their workshops. So I suppose I've got a pretty good insight into what the instructors gain
through the instructors training and what they may have difficulties with when they
have to fly on their own. As Software Carpentry expands, having a good mentorship 
programme and support for instructors is essential.
