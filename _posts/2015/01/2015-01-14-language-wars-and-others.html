  We often get asked, "Why do you teach [X]?  Why don't you teach [Y]?"
  where X and Y are random permutations of Perl, Python, R, MATLAB, Julia, C++, and Javascript,
  or equally random permutations of different version control systems or text editors.
  There are three answers:

      We'd be happy to,
      provided you will create and maintain a lesson that covers the same basic ideas as
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/lessons/">our existing ones</a>.
      (Cf. "<a href="http://third-bit.com/2011/05/28/you-doesnt-exist.html">You Doesn't Exist</a>".)

      If you're in the United States,
      you measure distance in miles and weight in pounds
      because that's what the people around you use.
      Similarly,
      if a community of scientists are using [X] and condition #1 is satisfied,
      we'll teach our fundamental ideas&mdash;task automation, modular programming, version control, and structured data&mdash;using [X],
      because those ideas are what really matter.

      When someone says, "Teach [X]," it's almost always because they believe it's better.
      When asked for evidence, though,
      they almost always respond with personal anecdotes
      or the sort of <em>a priori</em> reasoning that led Aristotle to believe that
      heavy objects must fall faster than light ones.
      We can do better:
      we can <a href="http://neverworkintheory.org/2014/01/29/stefik-siebert-syntax.html">measure the usability of programming languages
      through control experiments</a>.
      And I think that means we have an obligation to:
      as I've said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e26rp6qPbA">many times</a>,
      if we want other people to pay attention to the evidence when it comes to things like climate change,
      we need to demand and respect evidence ourselves.
