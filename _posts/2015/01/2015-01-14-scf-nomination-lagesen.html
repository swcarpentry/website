  I have been involved with Software Carpentry since I attended a
  workshop in Oslo, Norway, in 2012. I started out as a student, then
  went through the second round of instructor training, before being
  an instructor at my first workshop in 2013. Since then, I have
  organized one workshop and been an instructor at five others. I have
  also been involved with revamping the pre-assessment forms. This
  work has been very fulfilling and challenging on very many levels,
  and I now want to expand on my efforts by volunteering for the
  steering committee.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  I got my PhD in bioinformatics from the University of Oslo in
  2008. My reason for choosing bioinformatics was simply that I could
  not figure out whether I preferred molecular biology or computer
  science, and thus I ended up doing both. During both my master's and
  my PhD work I did however become more computationally oriented, and
  today I would no longer trust myself with a pipette. I also have
  quite a lot of experience with high performance computing, both as a
  user and as a system administrator, and I know how infuriatingly
  frustrating these systems can be.
</p>
<p>
  Since finishing my PhD, I have worked with people from many
  different backgrounds. I have frequently had occation to teach
  people with little to no computational education how to navigate a
  Unix system and how to do basic programming and analyses. This has
  been a lot of fun, but has also challenged my skills at translating
  between fields. It has also made me very aware of how difficult it
  is for somebody with no training in these fields to bootstrap
  themselves up to a level where they can get things done. From a
  bioinformatics perspective, this has for me made the skills that
  Software Carpentry teaches especially important. Bioinformatics as a
  discipline exists almost entirely within an Unix world, making the
  ability to work within that world quite crucial.
</p>
<h2>Commitment</h2>
<p>
  If elected, my main focus will be on mentoring instructors, and on
  building a Software Carpentry community. We are a rapidly growing
  organization, and we have many new people going through instructor
  training. All of these have to pass the hurdle of teaching their
  first workshop in order to be certified instructors, however, that
  can be intimidating. We should also not neglect our existing
  instructor pool. Our curriculum has lately undergone drastic
  changes, and we should work towards making the current lesson
  material easy to adopt for both new and existing instructors. Also,
  many instructors only know one or two other instructors. Encouraging
  closer connections between instructors can both help get new
  workshops off the ground, and can also contribute to knowledge
  dissemination between instructors and help foster collaborations.
</p>
<p>
  Through my involvement with Software Carpentry, I have grown a lot
  in my own practices and in my own teaching. I now would like to help
  others experience the same by serving as a member of the steering
  committee. For more details about me, feel free to contact me on
