  In January 2012 I had the good luck to be in one of Greg Wilson's first
  workshops after he
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2013/06/lessons-learned.html#version-5-green-light">rebooted Software Carpentry</a>
  in the current two-day format.
  I ended up as a helper in that workshop, and a month later I was in
  Toronto teaching Python as Software Carpentry's first volunteer instructor.
  Over the past three years I have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>taught at more workshops than I can remember</li>
  <li>helped transition our materials from SVN to GitHub</li>
  <li>written lessons and <a href="http://ipythonblocks.org/">ipythonblocks</a></li>
  <li>recruited and mentored new instructors</li>
  <li>publicized Software Carpentry at conferences</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Volunteering with Software Carpentry has been one of the most rewarding
  things I've ever done and I'd be honored to continue helping
  as a member of the SCF Steering Committee.

  In college I studied aerospace engineering and astronomy,
  but I dropped out of grad school in 2008 to become a professional
  programmer specializing in scientific applications.
  Since then I've worked for
  <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/">NASA</a>,
  the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/portal/">Space Telescope Science Institute</a>,
  and <a href="http://www.synthicity.com/">Bay Area startups</a>.
  I'm currently a senior software engineer at
  <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/">Autodesk</a>.
  I work outside of Software Carpentry's core audience of scientific academics,
but I think my industry experience and connections can be valuable to Software Carpentry.
</p>
<p>
  As a member of the SCF Steering Committee I'd like to focus
  on three related topics in addition to day-to-day responsibilities
  of keeping Software Carpentry running smoothly:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Continue improving our tools and processes.</strong>
    The less time we spend on administration and setup the more
    time we spend writing and delivering lessons.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Expand the types of Software Carpentry workshops.</strong>
    The current two-day, four-topic workshops are working well for us,
    but I think we could expand to other formats, especially shorter ones.
    More instructors could participate more often if they had opportunities
    to teach for an afternoon or evening.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Improve diversity within Software Carpentry and among attendees.</strong>
    Supporting a diverse Software Carpentry is important for many reasons,
    most importantly that it's the right thing to do.
    But in addition, having a diverse membership will help us expand
    into new disciplines where the skills taught by Software Carpentry
    are needed (especially social sciences);
    and a diverse membership will help keep Software Carpentry full
    of fresh ideas.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These ideas are all related to and important for the continued growth
  of Software Carpentry, and I'm excited to help lead that growth.
