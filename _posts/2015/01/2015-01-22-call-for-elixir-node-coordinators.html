  One of the 2015 <a href="http://www.elixir-europe.org/">ELIXIR</a>
  Pilot Projects focuses on supporting training in collaboration with
  the Data and Software Carpentry initiatives.  The pilot "Working up
  and building the foundation for Data Carpentry and Software
  Carpentry within ELIXIR" includes a series of initial events across
  different ELIXIR Nodes.  In order to achieve the goal of running
  Data and Software Carpentry (DC/SWC) workshops, promoting the DC/SWC
  teaching model, developing and sharing of the training materials, it
  would be useful if not essential, that each ELIXIR Node has a DC/SWC
  Coordinator.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Coordinator would:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    (ideally) be a person who already is familiar with
    the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}">Software</a>
    and <a href="http://datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a>
    initiatives;
  </li>
  <li>
    help identify institutions within their Node which would like to
    host workshops;
  </li>
  <li>
    act as the first point of contact in their respective Node for
    SWC/DC (coordinating the communication between the organisations
    within the Node that want to organise workshops, etc.);
  </li>
  <li>
    act as liaison between the Node and Software Carpentry/Data
    Carpentry;
  </li>
  <li>
    help promote and organise SWC/DC workshops within their Node;
  </li>
  <li>
    help in outreach within their Node: distributing announcements
    about workshops, hackathons and SWC/DC instructors training.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  As
  the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/12/scf-membership.html">Organisational
  Membership model for Software Carpentry</a> is now established, the
  DC/SWC Node Coordinator would support establishing Partnerships and
  Affiliations within their Node.
</p>
<p>
  To start with, the Coordinators would help with
  identifying <strong>domain experts</strong> within the Nodes who
  would be willing to contribute to the training materials by taking
  part in the first hackathon: <em>Developing new and improving
  existing Data Carpentry materials to adjust them for the
  domain-specific needs.</em>
</p>
<p>
  The hackathon will be hosted by the Finnish Node on <strong>16-17th
  March 2015,</strong> and financial support for the hackathon
  attendees is available.  The hackathon will be then immediately
  followed by
  a <a href="http://apawlik.github.io/2015-03-18-csc-espoo/">Data
  Carpentry workshop</a> for life-science researchers. During the
  workshop we aim to test the training materials from the
  hackathon. Both events will be run by two experienced Data Carpentry
  instructors: Fran&ccedil;ois Michonneau (University of Florida) and
  Aleksandra Pawlik (University of Manchester).
</p>
<p>
  If you are interested in being the Coordinator, please
