  Hi!  My name is Adina Howe, and I thank you for considering my
  qualifications to serve on the Steering Committee of the Software Carpentry Foundation.
</p>
<p>
  Software Carpentry has played a major role in my professional
  development, and I would argue played an integral role in my ability
  to fulfill my dreams as becoming a tenure-track professor.  In 2008,
  I participated in a Software Carpentry workshop at Michigan State
  University as a postdoc.  At the time, my research required some
  computational prowess that I did not possess.  SWC
  provided me a foundation, resources, and mentors to help me improve
  my skills and discuss my frustration and eventually success!  This
  impact (and great instruction and mentorship) insprired me to join
  as one of the first round of instructors (2011-ish).  For more
  details, please feel free to peruse my

  vitae</a>.

  Currently, I am an assistant professor at Iowa State University in
  <a href="http://abe.iastate.edu">Agricultural and Biosystems
  Engineering</a>.  I am so excited to be leading
  the <a href="http://germslab.org">Genomics and Environmental
  Research in Microbial Systems (GERMS) Lab</a> where we apply all the
  skills that SWC teaches for teaching and research.  I hope to be
  developing classes integrating many of the topics we discuss for
  Iowa State as well.
</p>
<h2>Previous Involvement with SWC</h2>
<p>
  Like many of you, I have been involved in the development,
  instruction, and evaluation of workshops in the past three
  years.  I also am proud to say that I love to brag about SWC and the
  opportunities it provides.  I have contributed to bringing SWC to
  the state of Iowa, teaching both of the first workshops in the
  state.  In total, I have taught a total of 8 workshops.  I have
  helped recruit and mentor at least four to five new instructors
  (that I can think of).  The best way to summarize my involvement is
  that I have been and continue to be personally invested in SWC and
  advocate for the organization and its mission when I can.
</p>
<h2>What I'd like to do</h2>
<p>
  Going beyond my past role in SWC, I think my experience, strengths,
  and new position could help SWC in three strategic ways:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>1) Identify and serve a broader SWC audience</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The majority of my workshops have hosted graduate students.  A
      few professors, staff, and undergraduates have also been
      involved, and I think there is an opportunity to reach out,
      serve, and impact this audience.  Importantly, I think these
      opportunities are fundable (e.g.,
      the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517&amp;from=fund">NSF
      Research Experiences for Undergraduates</a>). I believe that the
      skills we teach are useful beyond STEM students and would like
      to explore these opportunities.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>2) Increase the effectiveness and impact of our lesson plans and examples</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      With the growing number of instructors, we have the energy and
      help to improve our lesson materials.  I'd be interested in
      exploring specific example datasets wrapped around SWC lessons
      that could be used for targeted audience.  For example, for
      bioinformatics, we could parse sequencing datasets rather than
      text files describing counting animals.  Though teaching the
      same lessons, I think this would be incredibly useful and
      attractive to students.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>3) Be thoughtful of the long term mission and visions of SWC and how we can make it a reality</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Funding for a program like this is always going to be a
      challenge, and I would like to have plans for moving forward in
      sustainable direction.  Further, I want to make sure that our
      mission and visions are discussed, representative, and
      transparent.  I want to make sure that we are creating a
      resource-rich community for not only our students but each
      other.
    </p>
  </dd>

<p>
  Thank you for your consideration of me for the Steering Committee.
  I have loved being involved with SWC and look forward to my future
  involvement in any capacity that helps the foundation!
