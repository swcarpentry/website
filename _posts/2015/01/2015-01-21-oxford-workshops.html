  The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at the University of
  Oxford hosted its first Software Carpentry workshop on 13th and 14th
  January. Instructor and co-organizer
  <a href="http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/currentmembers/fowler.php">Philip Fowler</a>
  has
  <a href="https://philipwfowler.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/software-carpentry-workshop-oxford-13-14-january-2015/">blogged about it</a>,
  and included both photographs and some bubble charts of the feedback he received.

  Separately,
  James Allen has blogged about the
  <a href="http://jpallen.net/2015/01/14/aopp-oxford-swc-debrief/">first</a>
  and <a href="http://jpallen.net/2015/01/18/aopp-oxford-swc-debrief-part-2/">second</a>
  days of a separate workshop that he ran at Oxford
  for people in atmostpheric, oceanic, and planetary physics.
  This was James' first time teaching for us,
  and his summary of things that he thinks could be improved
  includes some ideas that we'll fold back into the main notes.
