<p>"You can trust in Jason, he's your friend!" &mdash; Decent People</p>
<p>
  I can't recall ever running in an election - rule by fiat is what "just feels right" to me.
  I have on occasion thought about running for office but I usually lack ambition (although I'm <em>attracted</em> to power).
  The fantasy of being the candidate people vote for even though he is clearly against their interest just makes my pedipalps tingle.
  So, when I learned about the Software Carpentry Foundation election, I thought, "let's try that!"

<h2>Why I'm Asking for Your Vote</h2>
<p>
  Have you openly laughed or at least been freaked out by the possibility of my candidacy?
  The SCF will be laughing all the way to the bank as I work with the rest of the Steering Committee
  to think up ways to get funding to support SCF activities.
  I mean, have you seen my twitter pic (<a href="https://twitter.com/jasonwilliamsny">@JasonWilliamsNY</a>) &mdash;
  people don't come back to me with a "no."
</p>
<p>
  I'll be using my experience as the outreach and training lead for the <a href="http://www.iplantcollaborative.org">iPlant Collaborative</a>
  to focus on assessment.
  Since I first took SWC teaching training in 2014,
  I've been interested in a question articulated by one of my intellectual heroes, George W. Bush: "is our students learning?"
  Having taught more than 50 bioinformatics workshops in 20+ US states and 6 countries (that's a lot for an American)
  and having organized many more events than that,
  I'll use my experiences to improve how we run and organize workshops &mdash;
  collecting data that demonstrates impact, attracts funding, and enables rationally motivated improvements.
</p>
<h2>Additional Qualifications:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      iPlant Experience:
      this has given me the management chops to work with large virtual organizations spanning diverse institutional cultures.
      My responsibilities also include managing our own training evaluation program.
      I can process up to 5 conference calls simultaneously,
      though I like to keep it down to 2 or 3.
      I'm also a super-humble pleasure to work with.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Rational people are (for reals) interested in my opinions:
      whether its advising the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_High_Council">tlhIngan yejquv</a>
      on how #opensource buzzwords can defeat the Dominion,
      or working on The Genome Analysis Centre's <a href="http://www.tgac.ac.uk/STAB">Scientific Training Advisory Board</a>,
      people have actually invited me to say what I think.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Not afraid of looking or sounding stupid:
      that should be obvious by now,
      but this trait combined with colleagues who will keep me in check can actually generate some creative ideas.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I'll make you a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/QKHTs">pie</a> if you vote for me
      (at least the person who votes for me the most).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I'm a pretty <a href="http://youtu.be/TUjiK5849lI">good communicator</a>:
      SCF is going to need people who can advocate and represent it on various levels (teaching, funding, etc.).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  As my flight descends below the 10,000 ft. Wi-Fi cut-off,
  you hopefully now have a good idea of what I bring to the table that will help make the SCF successful.
  Remember,
  I'm not going to make it if everyone just votes for some unrealistic "ideal candidate" &mdash;
  toss me enough votes to place a strong 4th.
  Is that 500 words? Now it is.
