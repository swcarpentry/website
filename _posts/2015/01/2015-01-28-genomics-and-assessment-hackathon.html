  If you're working or interested in genomics or assessment,
  we hope you'll consider applying for our upcoming Data Carpentry Genomics and Assessment hackathon.
  We're very excited about this event
  and the opportunity to develop lessons targeting genomics researchers and build assessment
  into the Data Carpentry curriculum.
  Travel support is available,
  so please apply to participate!
  It's a short application,
  and the deadline is this Friday, January 30th.
  If you have any questions about the event, please let us know.
