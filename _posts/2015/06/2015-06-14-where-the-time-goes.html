  Last November,
  I wrote a post about
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/11/where-the-time-goes.html">where my time was going</a>.
  A lot has changed since then,
  including my workload,
  so here's an update:

  That's 50 hours in a week when I'm not traveling or teaching workshops,
  down from 57.5 hours/week seven months ago,
  and we have accomplished a tremendous amount since the Steering Committee was elected in January:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      the <a href="{{site.github_url}}/workshop-template">workshop template</a> is much easier to use;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      our lessons (mostly) conform to the <a href="{{site.github_url}}/lesson-example">new template</a>
      and have <em>almost</em> been published;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      we're holding regular debriefing sessions in which instructors from recent workshop can share their experiences;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      we've trained a bunch of new instructors,
      and run some very promising experiments with accelerated online instructor training;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      we're using <a href="{{site.github_url}}/amy">Amy</a> on a daily basis;
      and
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      more than a dozen organizations have signed up as partners or affiliates,
      and more are in the pipeline.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The list still doesn't include things that are vital to Software Carpentry's long-term health,
  like writing up instructor training or creating new lessons,
  but the foundation that will allow us to focus on that is almost in place.
