  It's time to start thinking about what should be in Version 5.4 of our lessons
  (which we plan to release in the middle of August to get us through to the end of the year).
  We have opened a discussion ticket for each of the core lessons on GitHub;
  please add your thoughts there.

      These issues supplement the discussion of
      <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-template/issues/242">changes to the template</a>,
      which resulted in
      <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-template/milestones/Version%205.4">these specific issues</a>.
      If you'd like to help with one of those,
      your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

      We have not included capstones or lessons that are still undergoing major development in this list,
      but if their contributors would like to create an August 15 milestone and try to be ready for then,
      it would be great to include them in the release.

      As always,
      if you would like to add something to a lesson,
      please try to identify what should be taken out to make room for it:
      instructor after instructor is telling us that
      what we have is already very ambitious.
