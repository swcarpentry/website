  With the continuing increase in the importance and prevalence of
  software developed in support of science, there is a need to gather
  a set of best practices and case studies to serve as a standard
  reference book. We are producing a peer-reviewed, edited book to
  address this need. The book will be composed of chapters related to
  one of three topics that address the important needs. The book will
  have three sections, each related to one of those topics. The
  outline below enumerates those sections along with examples of the
  types of chapters that would fit within those sections. We solicit
  proposals from interested authors. Chapter proposals should fit into
  one of the following book sections.

<p>
  <em>Section I - Examples of the Application of Traditional Software
  Engineering Practices to Science.</em>
  <br/>
  This section will include chapters
  that describe generalizable experiences with applying traditional
  software engineering practices to the development of scientific
  software. Chapters should describe the practice, how the practice
  had to be modified to work in a scientific environment, and any
  lessons learned from using the practice. Note that it is preferable
  for chapters to contain real data, e.g. a case study, over simply a
  theoretical argument. Examples of the types of chapters this section
  will include are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    chapters describing practices that are being adopted in scientific
    environments, e.g. version control or unit testing;
  </li>
  <li>
    chapters describing practices that have potential benefit to
    science but currently lack adoption, sufficient evidence, or case
    studies, e.g. Continuous Integration, code review, documentation;
    and
  </li>
  <li>
    chapters describing practices in which scientists have shown
    interest, but there is a lack of evidence from the software
    engineering perspective, e.g. test-driven development.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <em>Section II - Advances in Software Engineering through
    Application to Science Problems.</em>
  <br/>
  This section will include chapters that focus on how the field of
  software engineering has been advanced because of experiences from
  developing scientific software. Examples of the types of chapters
  this section will include are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    chapters describing the use of software engineering at extreme
    scale, e.g. latency effects, synchronisation, handling failures;
  </li>
  <li>
    chapters describing quality assurance (e.g. testing or code
    reviews) in highly distributed, extreme-scale environments;
  </li>
  <li>
    chapters describing quality assurance in situations where the
    "correct" answers are not known, or are difficult to check;
  </li>
  <li>
    chapters describing development of mixed-language software;
  </li>
  <li>
    chapters describing particular techniques working with legacy
    code; and
  </li>
  <li>
    chapters describing software engineering techniques for handling
    large, highly-distributed, rapidly varying, and/or dirty data.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <em>Section III - Practices coming from outside both Software
    Engineering and Science which have relevance for the intersection of
    the two.</em>
  <br/>
  This section will include chapters that focus on how techniques and
    practices coming from outside the field of software engineering
    are advancing the practice of software engineering for scientific
    software. Examples of the types of chapters this section will
    include are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    chapters describing how community management and engagement best
    practice (e.g. from volunteer or campaigning communities) can be
    used for scientific software;
  </li>
  <li>
    chapters describing how economic models can be used to improve
    management and decision-making in relation to development of
    scientific software;
  </li>
  <li>
    chapters describing how systems engineering approaches might
    relate to scientific software development and organisation;
  </li>
  <li>
    chapters describing how education and training practices can be
    applied to improve the software engineering practices used in
    science;
  </li>
  <li>
    chapters describing how working practices from other industries
    (e.g. creative, manufacturing) have been applied to improve the
    efficiency or effectiveness of scientific software development;
    and
  </li>
  <li>
    chapters on the application of other ideas that have an impact on
    the intersection of software engineering and science.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Chapter proposals should be 2 pages or less and contain the
  following information:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Author(s) and qualifications
  </li>
  <li>
    Chapter title
  </li>
  <li>
    Section of the book
  </li>
  <li>
    Abstract of the chapter
  </li>
  <li>
    Detailed outline for the chapter
  </li>
  <li>
    Justification for chapter's inclusion in book
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Proposals should be submitted in PDF format
  to <a href="mailto:carver@cs.ua.edu">Jeffrey Carver</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Important Dates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    June 15, 2015 - Chapter proposals due
  </li>
  <li>
    July 1, 2015 - Results of proposal review announced, chapter
    invitations sent
  </li>
