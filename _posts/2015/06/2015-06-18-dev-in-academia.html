  Derek Groen, Xiaohu Guo, James Grogan, Ulf Schiller, and James Osborne
  have just submitted a paper to arXiv.org titled
  "<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05272">Software development practices in academia: a case study comparison</a>".
  From the abstract:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
     Academic software development practices often differ from those
     of commercial development settings, yet only limited research has
     been conducted on assessing software development practises in
     academia. Here we present a case study of software development
     practices in four open-source scientific codes over a period of
     nine years, characterizing the evolution of their respective
     development teams, their scientific productivity, and the
     adoption (or discontinuation) of specific software engineering
     practises as the team size changes. We show that the transient
     nature of the development team results in the adoption of
     different development strategies. We relate measures of
     publication output to accumulated numbers of developers and find
     that for the projects considered the time-scale for returns on
     expended development effort is approximately three years. We
     discuss the implications of our findings for evaluating the
     performance of research software development, and in general any
     computationally oriented scientific project.
