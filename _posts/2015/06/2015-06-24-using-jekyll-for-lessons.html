<p>
  A recurring complaint about our <a href="{{site.github_url}}/lesson-template">lesson template</a>
  is that it requires authors to commit generated HTML files to their repositories
  as well as their Markdown source files.
  This is necessary because we use <a href="http://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> to convert Markdown to HTML,
  but GitHub will only run <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.
</p>
<p>
  There were a bunch of reasons for using Pandoc instead of Jekyll,
  but it is now clear that the simplicity of only committing Markdown&mdash;i.e.,
  of using GitHub pages the way they're meant to be used&mdash;is more important.
  We have therefore created
  <a href="https://github.com/gvwilson/using-jekyll">a prototype of a Jekyll-based template</a>
  (which is rendered <a href="http://gvwilson.github.io/using-jekyll/">here</a>).
  The most important changes are:
</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Only the source Markdown files go into the repository's <code>gh-pages</code> branch,
      <em>not</em> the generated HTML
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The lesson's title, repository URL, and other values are defined once
      in a configuration file called <code>_config.yml</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Blockquotes are styled like this:
    </p>
<pre>
> ## Title
>
> body
{: .style}
</pre>
    <p>
      instead of like this:
    </p>
<pre>
> ## Title {.style}
>
> body
</pre>
    <p>
      Code blocks are styled similarly,
      i.e.,
      with the style <em>after</em> the block instead of at the top.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  People using source formats other than Markdown,
  such as R Markdown or Jupyter Notebooks,
  will still need to convert their files to plain old Markdown
  (styled as shown above)
  in order for them to be rendered properly by Jekyll.
  And we'll need to upgrade the format checking script,
  which means finding a Kramdown-compatible parser in Python
  (or getting Kramdown to spit out its AST as a data structure
  that a Python program can consume).
  But most of these things have to be done anyway,
  and it seems that most of our contributors think they're a price worth paying
  for a "real" GitHub Pages experience.

  If you think we should stick with our existing tools,
  please say that too.

  Postscript:
  many people have said they want the change,
  largly because it brings us in line with the standard GitHub Pages workflow
  (which Data Carpentry is using).
  Several others have counter-arguments,
  some of which are in 
  <a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/pipermail/discuss/2015-June/003118.html">this thread</a>
  from our discussion list.
