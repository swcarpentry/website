  The indefatigable <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#silva.raniere">Raniere Silva</a>
  has just posted a description of
  <a href="http://blog.rgaiacs.com/2015/06/20/swc_ufc.html">a workshop at the University of Cear&aacute;</a>
  that he and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#ushizima.daniela">Dani Ushizima</a> just finished teaching.
  It went well,
  and there are a lot of good ideas in his write-up &mdash; please check it out.
