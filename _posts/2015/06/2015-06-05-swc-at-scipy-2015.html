  This year at <a href="http://scipy2015.scipy.org/">SciPy 2015</a>
  Software Carpentry is excited to be running a full two-day
  <a href="https://jiffyclub.github.io/2015-07-06-scipy/">workshop</a> during the
  <a href="http://www.scipy2015.scipy.org/ehome/115969/289057/">tutorials</a>
  that precede the main conference. We'll be covering our
  <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html">standard topics</a>
  of shell, introductory Python, and version control
  with Git. We'll also be teaching a unit introducing the basic libraries of
  scientific Python. Attendees need not have any experience with the topics we
  cover.
</p>
<p>
  We have our usual goals of helping scientists do more in less time with less
  pain, but at SciPy we also have a bonus goal of easing Python novices into the
  conference. A technical conference can present a steep learning curve to people
  unfamiliar with the field and we hope that a Software Carpentry workshop
  beforehand will give attendees a boost before wading into the conference
  deluge by exposing them to basic Python concepts and fundamental scientific
  Python libraries.
</p>
<p>
  There is still plenty of room in the Software Carpentry tutorial, so if this
  seems useful to you please
  <a href="http://scipy2015.scipy.org/ehome/115969/259272/">register with SciPy</a>.
  And if you know anyone who
  would benefit from a workshop and would be interested in the conference please
  share this with them. Hope to see you in Austin!
