  Back in April,
  Jeffrey Chang wrote wrote
  <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/core-services-reward-bioinformaticians-1.17251">an article for <em>Nature</em></a>
  in which he pleaded for those who analyze bioinformatics data
  to be recognized as creative collaborators in need of career paths.
  In it, he observed:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    To give greater support to researchers,
    our centre set out to develop a series of standardized services.
    We documented the projects that we took on over 18 months.
    Forty-six of them required 151 data-analysis tasks.
    No project was identical,
    and we were surprised at how common one-off requests were.
    There were a few routine procedures that many people wanted,
    such as finding genes expressed in a disease.
    But 79% of techniques applied to fewer than 20% of the projects.
    In other words,
    most researchers came to the bioinformatics core seeking customized analysis,
    not a standardized package.

  This is why we teach what we teach:
  almost by definition,
  if someone is doing research,
  she's doing things that haven't been done before,
  and therefore don't (yet) exist in an off-the-shelf package.
  Just as in the lab,
  what we can know is limited by what we can do.
  This is also why
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/why-we-dont-teach-testing.html">teaching testing is hard</a>:
  each one of the unique analyses Chang identified might need to be checked in a different way.
