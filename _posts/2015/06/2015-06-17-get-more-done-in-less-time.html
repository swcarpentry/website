  Over the past year,
  Alexandra Simperler has interviewed participants in Software Carpentry workshops
  to find out what impact we've actually had on their work.
  Her results are
  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02575">now available on arXiv.org</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
     The aim of this study was to investigate if participants of
     Software Carpentry (SC) get more done in less time. We asked 32
     questions to assess 24 former participants to analyse if SC gave
     them the computing skills to accomplish this. Our research shows
     that time was already saved during the workshop as it could
     shorten the learning process of new skills. A majority of
     participants were able to use these new skills straight away and
     thus could speed up their day to day work.

  Like <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6220">Jory Schossau's study</a>,
  Alexandra's work shows that workshop participants believe we're making their lives better.
