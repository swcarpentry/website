  We are very pleased to announce the addition of a lesson on
  <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/make-novice">automation and Make</a>,
  which was created by the SSI's Mike Jackson and Steve Crouch.
  The <a href="{{site.github_url}}/make-novice">repository</a> contains everything you need to teach it,
  and pull requests are very welcome.
