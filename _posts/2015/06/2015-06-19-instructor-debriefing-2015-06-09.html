<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>We held our 11th round of instructor debriefing last week where we discussed the Software 
Carpentry workshops held at the University of Oslo, University of Connecticut, University 
of Campinas, University of the Basque Country, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley Institute 
for Data Science, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, and Oklahoma State University, as 
well as a Data Carpentry workshop at the National Data Integrity Conference at Colorado 
State University. At this debriefing we also had 3 new instructors join us (who have yet to 
teach a workshop but will be teaching one in the near future) to gain an insight about 
what works (and what doesn't) at our workshops out in the wild.</p>

<h2>What was difficult</h2>
<p>At this debriefing session there were several challenges that instructors reported 
facing during recent workshops, these include: underuse of of the Etherpad by students, 
students getting Git repositories confused (owner versus collaborator) because they had 
the same name, difficulties gauging students understanding and progress when teaching 
remotely and having not enough challenge or multiple choice questions for participatory 
learning.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no simple solution to getting the students to embrace 
the Etherpad, especially if they have never used this type of technology before. Some 
strategies employed by instructors include using the Etherpad chat to do an ice-breaker
exercise at the beginning of a workshop, letting the students know that this note-pad will
remain after the workshop so that they will be able to refer back to it in the future, and 
getting students to paste the answers to their challenge questions into the etherpad. This
last suggestion is brilliant for two reasons, one, it encourages use of the etherpad, and 
two, it clearly illustrates to students that there is often many ways to solve a problem
with code.</p>
<p>Difficulties in feeling connected with students was a concern for many instructors while 
teaching remotely at the workshop at the University of Campinas in Sau Paulo, Brasil.
Instructors reported not being able to read students' body language to see how well or not
well things were going. There were also technical difficulties with the audio speaker on 
Day 1 of the workshop with instructors having to repeat material that had been missed. This
caused confusion and the instructors covered less material than they had hoped. The 
students were able to follow along with the lesson material but also reported that they
felt disconnected from the instructors. For more information about this remote workshop, 
please visit Raniere Silva's blog:

<p>Thus it seems, that although remote teaching is a fantastic way to bring Software 
Carpentry workshops to remote regions (or places that simply don't have SWC instructors 
yet), we clearly need to do more to better prepare our instructors to teach remotely. We
may also need to adapt our workshop style and perhaps our workshop expectations to 
more successfully deliver our material remotely in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, for difficulties, both Git and Python instructors found themselves wishing for
more challenge questions. Specifically for Python, it was the longing for more multiple 
choice questions. These are especially useful tools to quickly probe your teaching and 
students learning, and gives you a chance to uncover any misconceptions that arose during
a lesson. Thus, if anyone has any spare time and has Git or Python expertise - please
help us out by creating some new challenge material for these lessons (especially of the 
multiple choice format) and submit them as a pull request.</p>
<h2>What worked really well and we should try again</h2>
<p>Some of the things that went really well at recent workshops were the multiple choice 
questions (the ones that we have and instructors used were really valued by the students), 
getting students to sign-up for workshops in groups of people who know each other, and 
using Dropbox to capture and share the code presented by the instructor.</p>
<p>The value of peer programming is well known and often touted by our instructors, but 
sometimes it is a challenge to get people talking and working together during a workshop.
An example of one successful way to promote this came from a recent workshop at the 
Murdoch Childrens Research Institute in Melbourne where organizers/instructors strongly
encouraged people to sign-up for the workshop in groups. They reported that 
having people who know each other at the workshop made is so that they always have someone 
to talk to and then have support to continue using the skills they learnt at the workshop
when they get back to their labs.</p>
<p>Finally, instructors from Oklahoma State University synced their iPython notebook to a 
Dropbox share translated by <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org">nbviewer</a>. They found that this
really worked well for students who fell behind and needed to see code that was no longer
on the instructors screen to catch-up, as well as for those students who wanted to review
what had been covered. If Python is taught across two days, the instructor can also clean 
up the notebook before the start of the second day so all students can start at the same 
place with working code.</p>
