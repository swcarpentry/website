  At the beginning of June R&eacute;mi Emonet, Kwasi Kwakwa, and Chelsea Chisholm
  ran a workshop at CERN.
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#emonet.remi">R&eacute;mi</a>
  has just <a href="http://home.heeere.com/teach-swc-cern-201506.html">posted a review</a>.
  It went well,
  and there are a lot of good ideas in his write-up&mdash;from
  using a whiteboard for diagrams to
  the IPython Notebook's successor (<a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>)
  and some semi-improvised intermediate material.
