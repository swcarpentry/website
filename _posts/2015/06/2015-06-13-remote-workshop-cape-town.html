<p>
  Last month we ran a workshop at Stellenbosch University in South
  Africa.  The workshop instructors were Laurent Gatto (from the UK -
  coming in as remote instructor), and two local instructors - David
  Merand and Anelda van der Walt.  We had four helpers in the room and
  32 participants.
</p>

<p><strong>Key points from remote instructor's point of view:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
  <p>
    Local instructors and helpers should actively facilitate interaction between remote instructor and participants.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    High quality sound and visuals are essential.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    It is very hard for the remote instructor to help build better instructors (see below for more details).
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Cultural differences may be hard to appreciate for the remote instructor and may cause break down of communication.
  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key points from host point of view:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
  <p>
    We experienced the remote instruction to be almost as successful
    as having a more experienced instructor present in person and will
    certainly run remote sessions again.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    We felt that the remote instructor was definitely losing out on
    the "highs" of the workshop - the networking after day one, the
    conversations during breaks, and the good byes after all is said
    and done.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    It is critical that the local instructors do not appear to "own"
    the communication with the remote instructor (I often acted like
    an interpreter between participants and Laurent and should have
    encouraged them to talk directly with Laurent rather).
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    It might be even more important to on-board helpers early on in
    planning phases of remote instructed workshops to build a
    relationship with the remote instructor before the workshop
    starts.
  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Remote Instructor's Experience:</strong></p>
<p>
  Interaction is key, even more so than in front of the class, where
  it generally happens, while remotely, it has to be actively
  promoted.  When teaching locally, it is the speaker that is the
  centre of the interaction; when teaching remotely, the local helpers
  have to drive and take over parts of the interaction.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remote instructor: be able to see participants: ideally, have 2+
      screens to see the participants and the shared screen. For the
      students, it might even be useful to have a small window with the
      presenter.  Aim is to make is as personal as possible, enable some
      spontaneity and make it apparent; in other words as different as
      possible from a pre-recorded video. This makes it technically a
      bit more challenging (several screens/projectors in addition to
      sound to manage).
    </p>
    <p>
      (From the host) I think having another window on the laptop
      (single screen might not be manageable for participants switching
      between RStudio, Etherpad, course material, and then also the
      video link.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To facilitate interaction, have a way for students to report back
      on specific questions/issues (rather than tell them they can ask
      the etherpad chat whenever they want). I used the etherpad for
      this
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Most important point. The local instructor/organiser should
      promote interaction by asking questions, and informing the
      remote instructor when to carry on after an exercise. The
      sessions I taught on the second day seemed to flow more smoothly
      with Anelda's support. I would go as far as having some
      pre-defined questions the local instructor should ask to
      demonstrate that interrupting the voice that comes from the
      microphone is perfectly acceptable, even encouraged.
  </p>
</li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I have the feeling that the pace of a lesson is much slower when
      remote teaching. It is important to be particularly clear and
      repeat essential points multiple times, ask if everything is clear
      and one should not expect that no answer means that it is actually
      clear. Hence the importance of the local instructor to participate
      in the questions/answers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Obvious, but can't be emphasised enough: quality of sound and video are essential. We used Google Hangouts and, 
      despite some non-catastrophic issues, it worked reasonably well (from the remote instructor's point of view, at least).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Following up from some comments from the local instructors, I think that:
    <ol>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Computer labs and excellent network infrastructure might
	  just be an absolute requisite for remote teaching...
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Regarding costs, there is bound to be some financial
	  investment, in particular if the goal is to make remote
	  teaching as effective as in-person teaching. I think we will
	  have to gain experience to assess the additional costs
	  (equipment, software, ...) and student/instructor experience
	  of remote teaching to assess have a better idea of real
	  costs.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This leads me to the following questions:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Why remote reaching?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Due to the number of SWC bootcamps that are organised around the
      world and the benevolent nature of the activity, it is not
      possible to always guarantee the presence of an experienced
      instructor. To provide some support to new groups and
      initiatives that emerge, being able to have somebody with some
      experience joining remotely is hence an interesting alternative,
      that directly addresses the aforementioned shortcoming. It
      enables to expand the SC network, events and instructors,
      albeit, as I will try to argue, in a more diffuse way.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>What are we missing when teaching remotely?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Communication during the classes is more difficult due to the
      remote nature of the exchange.  This lessened interaction
      happens in the actual teaching, but also in the perceiving of
      the difficulties of the students, the informal discussion that
      break the ice, the opportunity for instructors to act as helpers
      when they don't teach a lesson, ... and the inability to
      perceive and adapt to cultural differences (if we remote teach,
      if might be because the course is in a remote location). There
      is hence substantial aspects of the quality that can be missed
      out, but there is no doubt that by gaining experience in remote
      teaching, adjusting the teaching material and familiarisation
      with adequate infrastructure will lift, or at least reduce many
      of this current limitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another aspect that is
      missing is the
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/09/building-better-teachers.html">opportunity
      to build better teachers</a>.  As a remote teacher, it is hardly
      possible to listen to a full day of teaching, let alone
      participate in the direct support during the exercises, and
      hence discuss the course, learn from the experience and support
      the new instructors beyond the mere content. This is a rather
      crucial absence in the training of new and seasoned
      instructors.
    </p>

<p><strong>The Host's Experience:</strong></p>
<p>
  In April Greg announced an opportunity to run remote workshops on
  the Software Carpentry "discuss" mailing list.  We decided to take
  the opportunity to run a SWC workshop with remote instruction as at
  that stage we only had one qualified instructor in South Africa. Our
  idea was that running successful remote instructed workshops would
  decrease costs and thus uptake dramatically and will make SWC
  workshops more accessible for resource-poor universities. Our
  general experience was very positive and I will definitely encourage
  local universities to run workshops with remote instruction if they
  are unable to fund international travel for instructors. There are
  however a few critical points that may influence the success of the
  workshop - if success is defined as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      convincing students and researchers with limited computational background that they can use scientific computing tools as 
      taught by SWC, in their own environments;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      creating an awareness of where help can be found when
      researchers are experiencing challenges with computational
      aspects of their projects;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      building a community of researchers using similar tools for data
      analysis &mdash; in other words, starting a conversation between
      people who might not have known about each other if the SWC
      workshop did not take place; and
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      providing a platform for young researchers and students to
      practice their teaching skills
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  It is also important for the host to realise that other expenses
  might kick in when running remote instructed workshops - most
  notably is probably the cost of streaming video for two days if a
  host institution does not provide "free" internet access.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, both David and I was concerned for the remote instructor -
  is it as rewarding to do remote teaching as it is to build rapport
  with students and other instructors and helpers when you're
  physically participating in training?
</p>
<p>
  Laurent: Indeed, the social aspects are absent. But then, the point
  is to avoid the travelling - one can't have advantages of both
  formats.  It we focus on the interaction during the teaching, then
  the most important (social) aspects of the teaching could be
  preserved.
</p>
<p><strong>Finding an Instructor:</strong></p>
<p>
  Greg helped us to find a great instructor who was up for the
  challenge. I think experience is key.
</p>
<p><strong>Helpers:</strong></p>
<p>
  It might be even more important to draw in the helpers from an
  earlier stage in the planning phase to ensure they get to know the
  remote instructor and really feel part of the team. This could
  enhance communication during the actual workshop and give the remote
  instructor and helpers that extra opportunity to interact which is
  lost during the remote instruction. Earlier introduction and
  participation might also help with David's point below. Getting one
  or two extra helpers (to make up for the absence of the physical
  presence of the remote instructor) is probably a good idea. We could
  have made good use of one or two more helpers.
</p>
<p>
  David: We also need to empower the helpers so that they can alert
  the instructor if there are any issues that need addressing, items
  that need further explanation and so forth.
</p>
<p>
  Laurent on David's comment: Probably one of the most important
  lessons of this remote teaching experience, as far as I am
  concerned.
</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum and Communication Before the Workshop:</strong></p>
<p>
  I didn't experience the communication before the workshop much
  different from any other workshop. At our previous workshop we met
  several times via Google Hangouts or Skype to discuss the upcoming
  workshop too as instructors were scattered over three continents. It
  worked well.
</p>
<p>
  Due to the relative inexperience of participants (most have never
  programmed before) and the added risk of running a remote workshop
  we decided to only teach the R curriculum with some extras added by
  Laurent on ggplot2 and R Markdown. We also planned on doing a GitHub
  demo so that people were at least exposed to version
  control. Unfortunately very limited time remained for the GitHub
  demo and we experienced inexplicable tech challenges just at that
  point. People did hear about git/GitHub and version control
  throughout the two day training, but had limited opportunity to see
  it in action.
</p>
<p>
  This also reduced the problems experienced with setting up
  participants' laptops - they only needed to install R and RStudio.
  Only one student on an older version of Mac had challenges there,
  but one of our helpers (Raissa) was able to fix that. 
</p>
<p><strong>Organising IT/AV Support Locally:</strong></p>
<p>
  We tried to use Lync initially but switched to Google Hangouts the
  day before the workshop as none of us were too familiar with Lync
  (Skype for Business). I would rather in future set out to use Google
  Hangouts again as most learners/instructors are already familiar
  with the software and troubleshooting is much easier if that is the
  case. Also it relieves some pressure of relying on University IT
  support during the workshop. It does mean that not all participants
  can log into the remote instructor's session, but I suspect even if
  everyone logged in, the pressure on local wifi might be too much and
  sound may still be a challenge as people might forget to mute their
  speakers and sound.
</p>
<p>
  The computer running the Google Hangout session was connected to the
  internet via Ethernet cable rather than wifi. All participants were
  connected to wifi with no problems there.
</p>
<p><strong>Finding a suitable venue:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Sound: Using a venue with a built-in sound system rather than
      relying on the sound of a computer/laptop is critical. Our venue
      had a great sound system with microphone that could pick up
      sound from the back of the room (if people spoke up). The sound
      was also very evenly distributed in the room and people in the
      front and back of the class could hear equally well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our main challenge in terms of sound was sound clipping which
      may be caused by the software itself or by the connectivity.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Visuals: Everyone in the room could see the two screens projected
      in the front. We asked the remote instructor to increase the font
      in RStudio slightly but generally the projected material was
      equally visible from anywhere in the room.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interaction During the Workshop:</strong></p>
<p>
  As organiser and co-instructor, I was never frustrated with having a
  remote instructor on board during the course. Because I was
  constantly engaging with our remote instructor, to me it was as if
  he was in the room in a way. I believe others in the room had a
  different experience because very few participants (except maybe our
  other local instructor) engaged directly with the remote instructor,
  even during breaks or when he was asking questions.
</p>
<p>
  It's important to not create the idea that the microphone belongs to
  the instructor(s) to speak to the remote instructor, but to quickly
  open up the communication channels between the participants and
  remote instructor. In future I will put much more effort into
  connecting individual participants with the remote instructor and
  encourage them to chat with him/her during breaks.
</p>
<p>
  Our class was generally not very communicative and I'm not sure if
  this can be attributed to the remote instruction, cultural,
  something we did (or neglect to do) as local instructors, or some
  other factor. I don't think it had to do with the remote
  instruction.
</p>
<p>
  David: I think the local instructors and helpers should play an
  active role throughout the workshop to ensure good two-way
  communication between participants and remote instructor. It might
  also be important to consider accents of remote instructors
  especially if English is not local participants' home language.
</p>
<p>
  David: One of the major drawbacks for the remote instructor in my
  opinion was the lack of a whiteboard to be used for items such as
  drawing a flow chart, stepping through a loop showing the variables
  as they are initialised, printed whatever. I find I often want/need
  to stop using the material and engage with the class via a shared
  diagram created on the fly. This could perhaps be handled by the
  local instructor taking over at that point either of their own
  volition or when prompted by the remote instructor. There needs to
  be good synergy between the local and remote instructor in order to
  make this successful
</p>
<p><strong>Feedback sessions</strong></p>
<p>
  After every session the local instructors (and later also the
  helpers) huddled around the main computer in front of the venue to
  discuss the session with our remote instructor. We quickly read
  through all the sticky notes and discussed some of them as the need
  aroused. I sometimes felt it would have been more comfortable to
  have these feedback sessions in a more private setting, but on the
  other hand participants could see we were meeting after each session
  and were taking their feedback into consideration.
</p>
<p><strong>Social Interaction:</strong></p>
<p>
  As co-host, I really missed having the opportunity to thank our
  remote instructor properly by taking them out for dinner or treating
  them to some local experience.
</p>
<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>
<p>
  The workshop ended very abruptly due to the technical challenges
  experienced when we wanted to run the GitHub demo around 17:00 on a
  Friday afternoon... We should have finished 10 minutes earlier instead
  and made sure that we thanked everyone properly (participants,
  instructors, and helpers). I think the last 15 minutes left many
  participants confused and dissatisfied hence some of the harsher
  feedback on pink sticky notes during the last session.
</p>
<p>
  Everyone left without even saying goodbye to Laurent because at this
  stage his face wasn't up on the screen. Lesson learnt I would say
  :-)
</p>
