<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>
  Software Carpentry has grown and grown again since our re-launch in 2010.
  We are now helping thousands of scientists every year,
  and while many of our partners and instructors are now organizing workshops on their own,
  a lot of details still need to be sorted out to keep the whole show on the road.
</p>
<p>
  We therefore wish to hire a Program Coordinator to manage our day-to-day operations.
  This paid position will initially be part-time,
  but we expect that it will convert to full-time after a probationary period if funding allows.
  The successful candidate does not need to be either a programmer or a scientist,
  but must be well-organized,
  and can be located anywhere with reliable Internet access.
  The full description is included below;
  to apply,
  please email <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">{{site.contact}}</a>
  with "Program Coordinator position" in the subject line
  and a resume (either attached as PDF, or a link to something online).
  And please help us spread the word:
  we're a fun bunch to work with,
  and this would be a chance for someone to help a lot of scientists get more done in less time,
  and with less pain.
</p>
<p>
  Finally,
  I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Arliss Collins for all her hard work over the past year and a half.
  She is moving on to other duties now that our relationship with the Mozilla Science Lab has ended,
  but we couldn't have gotten through the past eighteen months without her.
  I'd also like to thank Amy Brown,
  who has come back to keep things going while we search for someone permanent,
  and welcome Kasia Zaczek,
  who is about to start handling workshops for us in Europe on behalf of Cyfronet
  in the same way that Giacomo Peru and Aleksandra Pawlik have been handling them in the UK
  on behalf of the SSI.
  Here's hoping that one day, somewhere,
  we can all get together for a group photo...
