<p>Today's the deadline for <a href="{{site.github_url}}/amy/milestones/v0.4">AMY v0.4</a>.
It contains a bunch of usability fixes, so all our admins should be happy :-)</p>

<h3>New features</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Filtering!</dt>
<dd>I couldn't get <a href="http://datatables.net/">DataTables</a> to work properly with our backend, but
thankfully I found out about <a href="http://django-filter.readthedocs.org/">django-filter</a>.  It's basically what
<a href="http://datatables.net/">DataTables</a> is, but works without JavaScript (which in case of our huge
data sets is a good thing).  A wide, fluid view was adapted for pages with
listings (so that we can put filters in the sidebar).  I must admit that
I like it.</dd>
<dt>"New" name</dt>
<dd>As you might have noticed, we're switching from "Amy" to "AMY", to not
confuse people with software.</dd>
<dt>Reports</dt>
<dd>Thanks to Greg's work, we now are able to simply report which events are
missing attendance figures, as well as display how many workshops, learners
or instructors we have over time.</dd>
<dt>Success/error messages</dt>
<dd>Each successful form save, or each erroneous action will result in
adequate message displayed on top of the page.</dd>
<dt>Horizontal layout of Find Instructors page</dt>
<dd>You won't have to scroll half of the page to get the results, because now
the skills take way less vertical space than before.</dd>
<dt>Search improvements</dt>
<dd>You can now search through airports, and search for events by their site name. Also, events ordering was changed: soonest show first.</dd>
<dt>Deleting objects</dt>
<dd>It's possible to delete almost any object we have in the database.</dd>
<dt>Improvements to bulk-upload</dt>
<dd>Greg made the person-bulk-upload useful! And Giacomo used it recently.</dd>
<dt>Pagination on airports list</dt>
<dd>Clicking through our stored airports is now possible.</dd>
<dt>Fixes to workshop selection for the debrief</dt>
<dd>Only events that started and ended in the specific period are going to show up.</dd>
<dt>View/edit icons in object listings</dt>
<dd>Two icons now make it possible for admins to view object details or go
right ahead to editing it.</dd>
<dt>Event fields ordering</dt>
<dd>We reorganized fields on the event detail/edit page. Now the slug is on top.</dd>
<dt>Line wrapping for fields with notes</dt>
<dd>Some notes had very long lines, but thanks to CSS3 goodness we can now break-up the words inside <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag.</dd>
<dt>Username visible</dt>
<dd>Person details page displays the person's username.</dd>
<dt>Link to event's repository and it's website</dt>
<dd>If either is provided, we display the other link too. For example, the
admin submits only the link to the repository. We parse it and display the
link to the event's website (because it's way easier to fact-check the
website than the repo).</dd>
</dl>
<p>We have also moved servers!  After continuing problems with support levels from A Small Orange,
we're now using Rackspace VPS and have a very clean deployment, plus we're SSL-only.</p>
<h3>You're gonna miss it</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Event "published"</dt>
<dd>Greg simplified the logic for marking events as published.  So now
"published" field is gone!</dd>
<dt>Breadcrumbs</dt>
<dd>We decided to drop the breadcrumbs.  They proved to not be as useful as
I hoped.</dd>
<dt>DataTables</dt>
<dd>Our listings were pretty big (for example if you wanted to load all
persons at once, you'd be waiting for about 10-20s for the site to come
up), so to maximize usability we'd have to turn <a href="http://datatables.net/">DataTables</a> into
"server-side processing" mode.  Basically, we'd have to do all filtering
and sorting on our end, and that would mean no benefit for us.  So instead
we switched to <a href="http://django-filter.readthedocs.org/">django-filter</a>.</dd>
<dt>Django Admin</dt>
<dd>We were not using it at all.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>What Did Not Land</h3>
<p>I'm trying to figure out a way to automate Eventbrite for admins, but from what
I can tell it's going to be impossible unless Eventbrite changes the way it's
working.  So I'm holding off with creating Eventbrite events, at least for now.</p>
<h3>Features for v0.5</h3>
<p>From Greg's <a href="{{site.github_url}}/amy/issues/374">ticket</a> we can
gather that most important feature for <a href="{{site.github_url}}/amy/milestones/v0.5">v0.5</a> is completing user's preferred
lessons and knowledge domains.</p>
