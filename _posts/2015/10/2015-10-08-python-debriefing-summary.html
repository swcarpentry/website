<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>

  Last month,
  we discussed results from a survey of
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/09/thinking-about-teaching.html">how our instructors are teaching Python</a>.
  We now have a summary of the feedback we've received in our bi-weekly debriefing meetings.
  The recurring themes are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>A greater choice of exercises and multiple choice questions would allow instructors to select domain specific examples and cater to varying levels of learner.</p></li>
  <li><p>Some instructors added an explanation of the Jupyter notebook or Spyder IDE environments.</p></li>
  <li><p>Some instructors added an explanation of basic Python datatypes before presenting the lessons.</p></li>
  <li><p>Comments that there is too much material to fit into a workshop and that some sections seem rushed.</p></li>
  <li><p>Request for a better explanation of the advantages of the Anaconda Distribution at the start of workshops and resources for post workshop learning.</p></li>
  <li><p>Comments on presenters style were positive for funny and entertaining examples and negative for highly mathematical examples.</p></li>
</ol>
<!--more-->
<p>
  The details are listed below, with '+1' showing points that came up several times.
  We plan to use all of this when we redesign our basic Python lesson.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Departures
    <ul>
      <li><p>Changed lesson to be more relevant to audience1</p></li>
      <li><p>Instructor used own examples to change emphasis of lesson to loops</p></li>
      <li><p>Re-organised the flow of lesson</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Additions
    <ul>
      <li><p>Explained differences between Bash, Python in the shell, Jupyter notebook</p></li>
      <li><p>Short Jupyter Notebook introduction</p></li>
      <li><p>Demonstrated Spyder IDE as well as Jupyter notebook</p></li>
      <li><p>Basic data types explained before starting +1</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Requests
    <ul>
      <li><p>More exercise options in repo +1</p></li>
      <li><p>More multiple choice questions</p></li>
      <li><p>Directions to post workshop resources needed</p></li>
      <li><p>Explain that Anaconda will install in a separate folder and not affect existing Python</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Comments
    <ul>
      <li><p>Testing section seemed rushed</p></li>
      <li><p>Lesson material too long to fit workshop length +1</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Using Jupyter Notebook with Git is challenging</p></li>
  <li><p>Lack of extensive history in notebook (compared to shell) hinders learners +1</p></li>
  <li><p>Starting with an empty notebook better than using template code</p></li>
  <li><p>Notebooks should be saved to repo in a cleared state, split up monolithic Jupyter Notebook (i.e. clear output) +1</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<p>implies not live coding.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructor Style</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Complaint: prime numbers example too mathematical</p></li>
  <li><p>Complaint: not enough discussion prior to challenges. (Learners: &quot;I don't know where to start!&quot;)</p></li>
  <li><p>Compliment: funny anecdotes received well</p></li>
</ul>
