  This is a long overdue post introducing myself to all of you. I've
  met many of you (at least virtually!) over the past few months but I
  wanted to formally introduce myself to the Software Carpentry and
  Data Carpentry community.

  My undergraduate and graduate degrees are in education &amp;
  psychology and educational linguistics, respectively. For nearly 20
  years, I've been teaching and managing educational programs in
  school and community based settings, in domains including cultural
  studies, literacy, and art.
</p>

  In 2010, I severely broke my leg.  I spent the summer homebound as
  the pins, plates, and screws holding it together healed.  I used
  that time to teach myself programming - it was the perfect way to
  spend my time when I was mostly immobile.  I started off learning
  Python and got hooked.  From there I learned SQL, some R, VBA,
  JavaScript, and some HTML and CSS - although I lack any visual sense
  needed for front end design work.  I've been involved in local tech
  communities and have taught several Python bootcamps. I used the
  skills I was learning to help with all the data management and
  analysis I needed to do for community based educational programs --
  just as we hope our students will do for their research.
</p>
<p>
  In 2014, I saw a listing for a SWC workshop in Philadelphia and
  considered signing up as a student.  It turned out the instructor
  was a friend of mine and actually asked me to help teach. This was a
  powerful reminder of "imposter syndrome" that many of us deal with,
  when I realized I was more qualified to be a teacher than a student.
  I signed up for the instructor training course later that year, and
  now here I am, working for Software Carpentry.
</p>
<p>
  I joined as staff in August 2015, and have spent the past few months
  developing systems to manage and organize everything it takes to
  make a Software Carpentry workshop happen.  Last month, I also
  joined Data Carpentry, working in a similar capacity.  Looking
  forward, I want to work with all of you to move beyond just the
  logistics and checklists of how workshops happen.  For our
  instructors, if you've taught many SWC/DC workshops, what makes you
  keep coming back? If you haven't taught yet, what can we do to make
  it easier for you to get started?  How connected do you feel to the
  SWC/DC community, and what can we do to support that? In what other
  ways (besides teaching) would you like to contribute (or have you
  contributed) to SWC and DC?  For our hosts and partners, how have
  you benefitted from hosting our workshops? What can we do do build
  on this?  And for our learners, how did our workshop impact your
  research?
