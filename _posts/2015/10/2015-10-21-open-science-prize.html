  The <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a>
  and <a href="http://nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a>
  have launched
  <a href="http://www.nih.gov/news/health/oct2015/od-20.htm">a global science competition</a>
  for new products or services to advance open science.
  Up to six teams stand to win US$80,000 each
  to develop their ideas into a prototype or to advance an existing early stage prototype.
  The prototype judged to have the greatest potential to further open science will receive $230,000.
