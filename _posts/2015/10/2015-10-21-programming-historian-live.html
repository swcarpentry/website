  On 19 October curious historians descended on the British Library
  for Programming Historian Live.
  The <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/">Programming
  Historian</a> is a suite of open access, peer reviewed lessons that
  provide practical instruction to historians thinking about using
  data, code, and software in their research. It is co-edited
  by <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/fellows/adam-crymble">2013
  Software Sustainability Institute
  Fellow</a> <a href="http://adamcrymble.org/">Adam Crymble</a> and it
  does an amazing job at bringing the methods and motivations of the
  (small but growing) Digital History community to the wider
  historical profession. This "Live" spin-off, funded by
  <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/fellows/james-baker">my
  2015 Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship</a>,
  was designed to take into account the fact that whilst some of us
  learn just fine through self-directed tutorials, others need the
  mental space, in person support, and peer pressure of seminar style
  learning.

<p>
  The programme of events was ambitious, some would say foolhardy
  (including me at the outset!). Across the day six trainers covered
  hands-on, practical introductions to
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">Extensible Markup Language</a> (XML),
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a>
  (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations),
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regular Expressions</a> (regex),
  <a href="http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/">AntConc</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29">Shell</a>,
  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29">wget</a>
  &mdash; a range of standards, software environments, and commands
  that intersected and cross-pollinated in pleasing, unexpected ways.
</p>
<p>
  The schedule ran to budget and to time. The attendees were well fed
  and watered. And <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/about">core
  values of the Software Sustainability Institute</a> &mdash; that we
  sustain software together, that we must critique our interactions
  with software, that we must get stuck in and cannot rely on "tech
  support" to get our research done &mdash; were communicated. All
  markers of a successful event. But what did we learn? What did we
  gain from a day of breakneck pace software skills training
  humanities style? From
  the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23proghist&amp;src=typd">lively
  Twitter backchannel</a> it seems we learnt a great deal:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      We learnt that digital practices, such as encoding texts using
      TEI-XML, help us reflect on everyday editorial practices, even
      on the choices we make when we approach texts and take meaning
      from them.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We learnt that investing effort upfront can enable us to
      re-imagine the texts we produce, even in the case of texts as
      simple as our notes, through transformation process such as
      XSLT.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We learnt that even the most simple looking lines of code can be
      powerful not only when applied to our data, but also &mdash;
      such as in the case of regex &mdash; with respect to their
      interoperability, their proclivity to pop up in all sorts of
      computational environments and software.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We learnt that unassuming software tools such as AntConc can
      tell us more than we imagined about the texts that we read and
      can introduce us to a world where communities love, support, and
      sustain software.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We learnt the command line, a vision of computing that sometimes
      we'd prefer to forget, have their virtues and a clear place in
      any historical research that uses data.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We learnt that software tools available on command lines can
      make us all archivists of the contemporary world.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      And we learnt that we wouldn't be able to learn all about this
      without the goodwill, hard work, and openness of people, people
      we should always remember to acknowledge. And so I'd like to
      take this opportunity to reiterate my thanks
      to <a href="http://mhbeals.com/">Melodee Beals</a>,
      <a href="http://www.history.ac.uk/about/jonathan-blaney">Jonathan Blaney</a>,

      <a href="http://peterwebster.me/about/">Peter Webster</a>,
      and all the attendees of Programming Historian Live for making
      the event such a rich learning experience.

  Finally, though conceived as a one-off, I'd be interested to hear
  from folks who think there is value in taking the concept further.
