<p>
On September 29th the mentoring subcommittee held the 19th round of Instructor
Debriefing and had some interesting discussions about our lessons
and opportunity for learners after the workshop.

<h2>Installation issues</h2>
<p>
Instructors reported the same rate of issues as in the previous debriefs:
few problems with Nano, version of Python, Git for old OS X, ...
</p>
<p>
At one of the workshops instructors had problem due mix of files with the same
name but different case, e.g. <code>file.txt</code> and <code>File.txt</code>.
Windows and OS X are case insensitive systems!
</p>
<h2>Surveys</h2>
<p>
Some instructors suggested improvements to the pre- and post-workshop survey.
The assessment subcommittee is working on a new version of the survey.
<em>If you want to help with the surveys please contact Jason Williams.</em>
<h2>Buddy Support System</h2>
<p>
Instructors from one of the workshops reported that they:
<blockquote>
  <p>
  ...introduced a buddy support system, where participants were split into
  higher (A) and lower (B) technical skill groups based on their submissions for
  pre-workshop survey. The most highly skilled participant from A was paired
  with the most highly skilled from B, the next highly skilled from A was paired
  with the next highly skilled from B, etc. At the workshop, nametags with their
  paired buddy on it were given out, and the pairs were asked to identify each
  other and sit together. Overall, the participants rated the buddy system
  4.0/5, and was found to be generally effective.
  </p>

</p>
<h2>Lesson topics</h2>
<p>
Instructors from one of the workshops reported that they wish
that the Python material be simplified because:
<blockquote>
  <p>
  ...it still caused a few pacing and conceptual problems,
  with lesson threads (in particular the NumPy and matplotlib material)
  getting a bit lost down digression/overly technical rabbit holes,
  and the fact that some language basics are taught
  after the more advanced use of libraries and data manipulation.
  </p>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
The development subcommittee, in charge of our lessons,
had one meeting on October 15th where changes to the Python lesson
were discuss. <strong>More information soon.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Live log</h2>
<p>
The <a href="https://douglatornell.github.io/2015-09-22-ubc/">last workshop at the University of British Columbia</a>
had a live log of shell commands during the shell and mercurial lessons on a web page.
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#latornell_d">Doug Latornell</a> allow us to share how they did it:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Create <code>live-log.sh</code> and add
  </p>
  <pre>
HISTTIMEFORMAT="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S $ "
PROMPT_COMMAND="history 1 >> ~/history.txt; rsync -qz ~/history.txt URL_OF_PUBLIC_REMOTE_SERVER:PATH/TO/PUBLIC/DIRECTORY/history.txt"
</pre>
  <p>
    to it. After that run <code>source live-log.sh</code> at your shell. Important points:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code> is used just to add timestamps to the commands.</li>
    <li><code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code> is responsible for most of the magic.</li>
    <li>You can replace <code>rsync</code> with any other tool that sincronize files between machines, e.g. Dropbox. The advantage of <code>rsync</code> is that users will use a clean url that you can set up in advance. <strong>If you are going to use <code>rsync</code> you must install <code>rsync</code> on your machine and on the remote server plus setup SSH key.</strong></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Steps after the workshop</h2>
<p>
Instructors from the University of British Columbia
also reported that they have a community study group
that are great to plug learners into after the workshop.
Many others universities have similar groups that we can work with
and could be interested in take part on the instructor training that we will run
this December.
<strong>
  If you know or are involved with such group,
  please advertise the instructor training.
