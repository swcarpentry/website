  I had a really good conversation yesterday with Cath Brooksbank and Sarah Morgan,
  who do training at EMBL-EBI in Hinxton.
  During the conversation we touched on <a href="http://www.coursesource.org/">CourseSource</a>,
  a peer-reviewed journal in which people can publish undergraduate biology lessons&mdash;not
  studies of the lesson's effectiveness,
  but the lessons themselves.
</p>
<p>
  This is a brilliant idea,
  and thinking about it has made me realize why
  I've never been excited about online lesson repositories.
  We already have repositories for the things academics do:
  they're called journals.
  And we have portals (or aggregators, or whatever you want to call them):
  they are things like PubMed.
  What we <em>don't</em> have is people putting things into the system in the first place.
  Growing a separate parallel system to do those things for lessons hasn't worked:
  as far as I can tell,
  most of what's uploaded to lesson repositories just sits there.

  Ever since we <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/09/publishing-our-lessons.html">published our lessons</a>
  I've been wondering why journals like <a href="http://www.coursesource.org/">CourseSource</a>
  aren't the norm.
  Academics invest a lot of time in creating teaching materials,
  just as they do with data and code:
  why aren't they trying to get as much recognition for their work on lessons
  as they now are for their work on the latter?
  Whatever the reason,
  I think peer review (pre-pub or post-pub, anonymous or not) is the obvious next step for our lessons,
  and I'm going to push for us to do this with the next version of our material.
