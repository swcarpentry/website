<p>
  The course is aimed at female postgraduate students,
  researchers and engineers who are familiar with basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, arrays, and functions
  but need help to translate this knowledge into practical tools to help them work more productively.
  Apart from learning a set of useful skills
  the participants will have a unique opportunity to network and discuss their experiences in working in computational research area.
  The Software Sustainability Institute, ARCHER, and Women in HPC are planning to run the WiSE events
  on regular basis at different sites in the UK.
