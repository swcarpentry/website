  With less than three weeks to go before Software Carpentry and Data
  Carpentry's first ever
  <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/instructor-retreat-2015/">Instructor
  and Helper Retreat</a> coming up on November 14, many of the lead
  organizers for sites around the world got together this week to
  discuss plans and ideas for the event. Our goal for the retreat is
  to create opportunities for instructors, helpers, and the community
  to get together to practice teaching, break ground on new lessons,
  and start discussions.  Here are just a few of the ideas coming up
  that you can get involved with.

      Many sites will be organizing <strong>practice teaching
      sessions</strong> for instructors and helpers to try out new
      material, hone their skills and get some feedback from a
      friendly audience. If you've been thinking of teaching a new
      unit for the first time but aren't quite sure about rolling it
      out in front of students yet, or if you've never taught at a
      workshop before and would like a little more practice, this is
      your chance at a dry run. Sites worldwide will be running events
      like these, both live and online; get in touch of your local
      organizers or a site in your timezone, and they'll help get you
      on the local schedule.

      One great new idea that came out of this discussion was
      a <strong>Worldwide Library Hour</strong>.  More and more
      libraries and librarians are organizing, hosting and leading
      workshops, and the library community is demanding Carpentry-like
      lessons focused on the tools used in library collection
      management and cataloging.
      <a href="https://twitter.com/laufers">Mark Laufersweiler</a>
      and <a href="https://twitter.com/tracykteal">Tracy Teal</a> will
      be convening an open, hour-long online conversation about the
      intersection of the Carpentries and libraries. Get in touch with
      them if you'd like more details.
    </p>

    <p>
      A number of groups will be hosting <strong>content
      sprints</strong> to generate, refine or enhance new lesson
      material in all of our lessons. For example,
      the <a href="https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/swc-instructor-retreat-2015-krakow">Krakow
      team</a> will be working out a collection of new multiple choice
      questions for the Shell and Git lessons, and library-focused
      work may come out of the Library Hour described above.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Some sites asked who would be welcome to attend the retreat; the
      answer is unequivocally "everyone", and if you'd like to open your
      doors to the broader community in your region, consider hosting
      an <strong>open house session</strong>. Many groups will be
      inviting people not currently involved in Software or Data
      Carpentry to come out, meet the community, and find out what
      we're up to. This is a particularly great opportunity for people
      in smaller communities or places without many instructors
      currently active; by throwing open our doors and reaching out to
      people who might be interested, we hope to encourage more
      workshops and more people to jump in as instructors and helpers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Several <strong>round table discussion sessions</strong> are
      being planned at sites around the world, from collecting and
      processing student feedback
      (<a href="https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/swc-instructor-retreat-2015-montreal">Montreal</a>)
      and data management planning
      (<a href="https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/swc-instructor-retreat-2015-ou">Oklahoma</a>)
      to adapting the Carpentries to non-science audiences
      (<a href="https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/swc-instructor-retreat-2015-toronto">Toronto</a>)
      and setting the right pace of a lesson
      (<a href="https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/swc-instructor-retreat-2015-krakow">Krakow</a>).
      Many of the roundtables will be broadcast and open to remote
      participation; feel free to get in touch with your site host to
      propose a new one.
    </p>

  <li>
    <p>
      A number of sites on the West Coast of North America are
      considering <strong>regional hangouts</strong> to create
      connections across their larger geographic neighborhood. In this
      way, we hope to enable the freer sharing of ideas and mutual
      support between neighboring communities.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These are just a few of the ideas that got brainstormed at this
  planning meeting, but the most important idea on the schedule of
  every site is <em>yours</em>.  If you have a question, idea, or
  activity you'd like to take up with your local community, get in
  touch with your local site leader and they will gladly help you
  make it happen. You can find their contact info by finding your site
  on the map below, clicking on the pin and on through the Etherpad
  link that will appear.
</p>
<p>
  There's still time to open new sites for the retreat and add
  broadcast talks and events to the schedule. If you want to get your
  event or your site on the map and schedule,
  <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/instructor-retreat-2015/issues">open an issue here</a>
  or <a href="mailto:mentoring@lists.software-carpentry.org">email the
  Mentorship Committee</a> and we'll get you plugged in right away.
