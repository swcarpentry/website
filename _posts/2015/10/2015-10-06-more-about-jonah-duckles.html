  I'm thrilled to be stepping into the role of Executive Director of
  the Software Carpentry Foundation. I come to you as an experienced
  instructional community member excited to share my administrative,
  grant writing and professional background to help the Software
  Carpentry Foundation become sustainable and reach exciting new
  goals.

  Iâ€™ve taught Software Carpentry around the world and it has made me
  passionate about spreading the movement. Scientists are
  accumulating data faster than their training has prepared them for.
  They need new approaches to raise the level of the technical
  conversations when thinking about complicated research challenges.
  Software Carpentry is an incredibly powerful approach for improving
  scientific exploration in this data-driven era. It helps scientists
  use their existing skills and do even more. Our work is important
  and has impact!

  For those of you that don't know me, I come to you from a position as
  The Director of Informatics and Innovation at The University of Oklahoma.
  My biggest successes at The University of Oklahoma came when I was
  able to empower researchers to tackle bigger challenges than they
  thought they were capable of. I was able to mentor and advise
  scientists in computation and data management so that they could
  imagine their research questions in new and more effective ways. I
  worked to build a university-wide coalition, providing the
  necessary funding and support structure to expand services to
  disciplines struggling with data and computational challenges.
</p>
<p>
  My scientific background is in the areas of Landscape Ecology and
  Earth observation remote sensing and I have been an analyst at a
  private firm which produces estimates of global crop production
  fusing satellite, weather and tabular data for its clients. I have
  also facilitated hands-on long-term technology planning workshops
  as a consultant with government agencies and large technology
  companies.
</p>
<p>
  I work most effectively in a collaborative and entrepreneurial
  ways, always hungering for new ideas and new ways to strategically
  position groups of people and organizations. In just the last five
  years, I've participated in over $30-million dollars in outside
  funded grants with my role involving leadership, teaching and
  mentorship in computational and data best-practices for the grants.
  I look forward to doing similar work for Software Carpentry,
  building grants and initiatives that can benefit The Foundation and
  its member organizations into the future.
</p>
<p>
  I am here to work with the entire Software Carpentry community to
  continue the excellent work that has already been done. I invite
  you to keep in touch with me and to give me your ideas about how we
  can work towards helping researchers accomplish more than they
  imagined they were capable of. I'm on twitter as <a
