  A common challenge that arises before or during a workshop is that
  participants' prior expertise in programming or broadly speaking
  their abilities of using computers for science is distributed
  randomly. At best, this distribution peaks at the expectations of
  the instructor. Usually, this distribution is quite wide and thus a
  considerable portion of the participants do lack the necessary
  predispositions for the workshop level, or have a slower learning
  rate or simply are too shy to ask questions. I recently taught a
  follow-up workshop to the Software Carpentry (SWC) Novice material
  and struggled to keep the pace of teaching at a level so all
  learners would come along. Given the feedback on the SWC mailing
  list (see the
  <a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/pipermail/discuss/2015-October/003396.html">original post</a>),
  this problem occurs quite often. Thus, this blog post is
  a summary of the discussion initiated among fellow SWC instructors
  on how to pull in those learners again that fall behind or how to
  pace/design a course so that a minimal portion of learners fall
  behind.

<p>
  Before running a course, it is very important to communicate the
  level of the course as precisely as possible to all those
  interested. This entails a list of topics to be covered (potentially
  even a under-advertised one so nobody is dissappointed), a
  pre-assessment form (along the lines
  of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/assess/pre-learner.html">SWC
  pre-assessment</a>), and potentially a piece of source code that
  illustrates the expected proficiency (April Wright). The latter
  being more important for intermediate learners. All of this should
  happen in close cooperation with the organizing host. Still, we have
  to expect a portion of the participants to be in a somewhat
  too-demanding course for their expertise (Greg Wilson) or who take
  "no prior computing skills" too literally (Amanda Charbonneau) and
  can barely type.
</p>
<p>
  Another approach (Bill Mills, Thomas Ballinger) is to portion the
  material in slots of 30 minutes and have reassurance questions
  (multiple choice with partner discussion afterwards) as well as some
  exercises. The exercises should have one "baseline" problem
  dedicated to the expected level after the session, so that every
  learner is aware that he should tend to this first. There
  could/should also be at least one more problem for more advanced
  students as well.
</p>
<p>
  Often, participants are left behind as they become out-of-sync with
  the live coding on the projector. Mike Jackson (SSI, UK) has come up
  with a simple tool to "stream" the terminal history to an online
  resource, so that participants can go back at their liking. The
  details are covered in an earlier SWC discusson
  (<a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/pipermail/discuss/2014-July/001902.html">July
  2014</a>) or in
  the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/10/weekly-update-2015-10-26.html">19th
  workshop debriefing session</a>. Other than that, there are terminal
  screen recorders available that might do the job as
  well: <a href="https://showterm.io/">showterm.io</a>, <a href="
  https://asciinema.org/">asciinema.org</a>, ... If possible, the
  terminal cast or history should be included in the workshops
  webpage. David Dotson notes that he commits his jupyter notebook by
  pressing a custom keyboard shortcut which then triggers an automated
  push to github. As github renders jupyter notebooks, this has proven
  very worthwhile. David also notes that this could be done by
  cron-job launching every minute.
</p>
<p>
  One common suggestion is to invite more advanced learners to step up
  if TAs are not available and help other participants that tend to
  fall behind easily (Titus Brown, Greg Wilson). In practise, this
  approach is often hard to implement by means of broadly asking the
  participants to step up (Peter Steinbach). Azalee Bostroem suggested
  that she plans to do an informal proficiency poll at the beginning
  of a course. Once more advanced learners have their hands up, she
  would emphasize to the not-so-advanced students that these people
  should be their resources in the forth-coming workshop and motivate
  novices to use them. Azalee and Thomas Ballinger also suggest
  explicit pair programming of advanced and novice learners after
  pairs have been assigned based on the abovementioned upfront
  poll. The novices might have more resources then to follow and ask
  questions rather than struggle with typing and coming along.
</p>
<p>
  Further, some instructors suggested to hand out the materials up
  front so that learners can turn to that at any time. I personally
  switch online from the prepared materials to live-coding: the
  materials also contain the learning objectives which serve me as a
  guiding lighthouse during the process help guide my teaching and
  help learners understand where we are goingof course this way
  students were already in touch with them. Also, many instructors
  underlined the importance of reiteration, to rephrase taught
  concepts for those that didn't digest them the first time. 
  Certainly though this is a two-side sword, Thomas Ballinger suggests
  an alternative mental approach on this: reiterating concepts in
  other words be done with the advanced in mind so they can fortify
  their knowledge from a different novices, while the novices get a
  chance to try again on the very same concept (I find this sentence
  confusing, isn't re-iteration intended to help the novices rather
  than expert learners?).
</p>
<p>
  A lot of fellow instructors emphasized that a central danger is that
  learners falling behind have a tendency to become frustrated and
  eventually give up. It was pointed out by Karin Lagesan that being
  lost with the little things is to be accepted as long as learners
  keep track of the general concepts of SWC materials. After all,
  instructors cannot expect a scientist to turn a programmer during a
  course. Instead an atmosphere of frustration tolerance should be
  created (Karin Lagesan, Sam Penrose, David Martin), where learnes
  accept the fact that they'll often run into errors and build up a
  frustration resilient mindset.
</p>
<p>
  To sum up, it is a given that learners will come to workshops with a
  variety of programming/computing experiencehave different
  preconditions when entering SWC (or any other) courses. We as
  instructors need to make sure that the pace of teaching suits the
  majority as the slower learning of a minority could and should never
  impact the learning success of the majority. However, clear
  communication upfront, constant feedback during the workshop, pair
  programming and well suited problems that are tailored to those
  present can help equalize the differences.  Keeping the above
  suggestions in mind can ensure all learners get the most out of the
  workshop, which is the goal of Software Carpentry.
