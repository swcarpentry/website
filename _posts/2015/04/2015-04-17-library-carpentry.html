  We wrote about
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/british-library-courses.html">the digital skills classes at the British Library</a>
  last October.
  We were therefore very pleased to see that James Baker,
  a <a href="http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digital-scholarship/2014/12/software-sustainbility-institute-fellowship.html">Software Sustainability Institute Fellow</a>,
  is piloting a new program called
  <a href="http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digital-scholarship/2015/04/library-carpentry-call-for-volunteers-call-for-participants.html">Library Carpentry</a>.
  The first run will take place in November 2015
  at the Centre for Information Science
  at City University London;
  <a href="http://librarycarpentry.github.io/city-november-2015/">the program</a>
  will consist of four three-hour sessions,
  each for 40-50 participants.
  <a href="http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digital-scholarship/2015/04/library-carpentry-call-for-volunteers-call-for-participants.html">The announcement</a>
  has more details,
  including a call for participants and another for volunteers.
  Please check them out,
  and lend a hand if you can.
