  The <a href="https://adainitiative.org/">Ada Initiative</a>
  ran their <a href="https://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/workshops-and-training/">Ally Skills workshop</a>
  at <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/">PyCon 2015</a>,
  and by all <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-pycon-ally-workshop.html">accounts</a>
  it was useful and thought-provoking.
  They don't do an online version,
  but you can watch
  <a href="http://youtu.be/Y2F_Bmx_CNE">this video</a>
  of a workshop at the Wikimedia Foundation.
  Recommended.
