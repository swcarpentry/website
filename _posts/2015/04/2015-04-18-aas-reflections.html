<p>
  We just finished<sup>*</sup> a workshop at the American Astronomical
  Society. I was lucky to recruit 3 instructors (in addition to
  myself) - Matt Davis, Erik Bray, and Phil Rosenfield. We also had
  Pauline Barmby volunteer as a helper (and on the fly
  instructor). While I wrote this blog post, you will see comments
  inserted by the instructors.

<h2>Pre-Workshop Meetings</h2>
<p>
  We started meeting at the beginning of October. Our first meeting
  was attended by only instructors. Despite a laughable number of
  technical difficulties we were able to decide on our curriculum,
  schedule, and who was teaching what. We held two other shorter
  meetings which included helpers to work out logistics and answer any
  questions (mostly mine). It was really nice to see everyone's face
  prior to the meeting. Additionally, we decided to meet the night
  before the workshop for a little more face time. I also set up an
  etherpad that held notes from all of the meetings. I found this very
  useful - other instructors and helpers can comment if they did.
</p>
<p>
  I asked all helpers if they would like to teach a 15 minutes
  sections. This is something I like to do at every workshop I
  lead. It gives helpers a chance to teach (if they are not familiar
  with it) and to get a sense of what it is like to be in front of the
  class: how fast to go, where do students get lost, what is it like
  to explain concepts. With a 15 minute piece of instruction time -
  even if the lesson is a disaster (which none of ours were) the
  workshop is relatively unaffected.
</p>
<p>
  I included the helpers and instructors on all correspondence prior
  to the workshop so that they knew the information that was given to
  the students on the first day and also to give them a window into
  the lead instructor's duties prior to the workshop.
</p>
<h2>Workshop Set-up</h2>
<p>
  We decided to use the set-up test script
  from <a href="{{site.carp_gh_io_url}}/workshop-template/setup/index.html">here</a>. I
  modified the first test script to test for specific versions of
  numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and astropy. I emailed the modified
  scripts to students prior to the lesson and a link to the
  instructions for running them. We were able to head off many
  installation issues. [I think this workshop had some of the fewest
  installation problems I've seen. --Erik]
</p>
<p>
  We also had a number of students show up early the first day for
  installation help. It is possible that having the installation
  script alerted people to when they did not have a correct
  installation. A number of students who ran the scripts downloaded
  them from the instructions rather than from my email. As a result
  they installed a number of unnecessary packages. These students
  encountered issues installing EasyMercurial and mayavi. Trevor King
  and I are currently working on an issue to comment out the packages
  we don't regularly teach in the default installation script. We had
  a lot of custom installations which often led to small differences
  and errors during the lessons (especially in Python). We also had a
  request from a student to modify the installation test script to
  handle dev versions.
</p>
<p>
  I also sent students the Etherpad link prior to the workshop. At
  Erik's suggestion I created a short link to both the course website
  and etherpad - this worked really well. [Is this mentioned in any of
  the workshop setup instructions? I think it should be, if
  not. --Erik]
</p>
<p>
  At my last workshop I received a number of comments regarding using
  Nano as the text editor. Specifically students wanted to know why we
  asked everyone to download Nano, used Nano, and then told them that
  they should probably use something else. As a result we had everyone
  download Sublime Text in addition to Nano. We still used Nano for
  the teaching git. Students seemed happy to know that they had
  Sublime Text and I saw many students opening and using it although
  we never formally used it in our lessons. Although we didn't try to
  link it to the command line, we encountered no installation
  issue. [I have a certain fondness for nano, but when we rely on it I
  do worry that it gives the impression to shell beginners that this
  is what they have to do if they want to edit files at the
  command-line. Not sure what to do about that. --Erik]
</p>
<p>
  We left 3 hours at the end of the day as flex time. We thought our
  schedule may be ambitious and wanted to leave time to either finish
  the lessons or allow the audience to ask questions. This wound up
  being a good call.
</p>
<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>
  During each lesson I assign a different person to take notes on the
  etherpad and answer any questions that arise. I try to make sure a
  different person is doing this each lesson. View our
  etherpad <a href="https://abostroem.etherpad.mozilla.org/2015-01-03-aas">here</a>. [I've
  had mixed success with etherpad use in workshops. I think this one
  was sort of in the middle but overall it was very good to
  have. People seemed to appreciate the notes in there, and it was
  also useful as a shared copy/paste. A few people asked good
  questions in the etherpad but not as many as I like to see. --Erik]
</p>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>
  On day 1 Matt Davis taught the shell in the morning. Astronomers
  generally have experience in the shell and as a result after a brief
  survey of the room Matt was able to start the shell at lesson 5 on
  loops. Even those students less familiar with the shell were able to
  follow along.
</p>
<p>
  Erik spent most of the rest of the day teaching Python. This group
  was mostly made up of people who had programmed before in another
  language and some who knew Python already. As a result Erik used his
  own lesson for teaching. This went slower than anticipated and we
  didn't cover moving from the notebook to command line scripts by the
  end of the lesson. Over dinner that night we discussed how we were
  going to adjust the schedule of the next day to account for this. We
  decided to give Pauline a chance to instruct and she worked on the
  end of the lesson that Erik was planning on covering and presented
  that on day 2.
</p>
<p>
  At my last 2 workshops we've decided to teach code review instead of
  testing. I believe that while many students walk away from our
  testing unit without knowing how to apply the testing to their work,
  code review is a valuable tool that can prevent mistakes and help
  build a community at the student's home institution. It is also very
  easy to implement and can easily be taught in 45 minutes to an
  hour. Matt mocked up
  a <a href="https://github.com/abostroem/2015-01-03-aas/blob/gh-pages/novice/code-review/data_processor.py">terribly
  written code</a> and we asked students to look at it in groups. We
  then went through each group and asked for a comment. I really
  enjoyed this section and thought it present a nice opportunity for
  students to implement the best coding practices they had just
  learned and for us to discuss it with them using a real
  example. It's also a nice way to finish off the day, by providing
  learners with an active experience that's not incredibly
  mentally-taxing.
</p>
<p>
  We asked for good and bad stickies at the end of the day and
  reviewed them over dinner.
</p>
<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p>
  We started day 2 with Git. I don't like to teach git entirely from
  the command line. Instead I like to present what we are doing and
  the command on slides - going back to the command line to do an
  example of what I've just told students and then putting up a slide
  with a challenge problem on it. I used slides.com to create an HTML5
  slide show that I could version control, send students links to, and
  present to the class. My presentations can be viewed
  here: <a href="http://slides.com/abostroem/local_version_control">local
  git</a>, <a href="http://slides.com/abostroem/collaborating_using_git">remote
  git</a>. Overall this strategy worked well. I followed the SWC
  lessons pretty closely for local git, although I left out the
  discussion of the gitignore file. I started out following the remote
  git lesson - having each student create a remote
  repository. However, to give them a sense of actually collaborating
  I had each person find a pair and assign one person to be Dracula
  and one person to be Wolfman. Wolfman then cloned Dracula's
  repository and I led them through a series of exercises where they
  first just pulled, modified, and pushed without the other person
  making any changes. Next they both modified but without
  conflicts. Finally they modified the same line and resolved
  conflicts. The whole Git lesson went much faster than I anticipated
  (I expected at least 3 hours and finished in 2.5).
</p>
<p>
  Next Pauline presented her Python lesson. This involved walking
  through steps 1-4 of
  Erik's <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/abostroem/2015-01-03-aas/blob/gh-pages/intermediate/python-simcluster/simulated.ipynb">'simcluster'
  notebook</a> which shows how to run python code from the command
  line, how to parse command-line arguments using argparse, and how to
  break code up into functions. This went relatively smoothly,
  although Pauline suspects it might have been a bit too fast for
  everyone to follow.
</p>
<p>
  In the afternoon Phil presented
  a <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/abostroem/2015-01-03-aas/blob/gh-pages/intermediate/matplotlib/Plotting%20with%20matplotlib.ipynb">short
  introduction to of matplotlib</a> and Erik showed the learners
  around <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/abostroem/2015-01-03-aas/blob/gh-pages/intermediate/astropy/Introduction_to_Astropy.ipynb">AstroPy</a>. Most
  of the Python we did on day 2 was presented in a show-and-tell
  manner where students executed pre-written code rather than typed it
  themselves. This was an effective way to show them what is
  available. While this is good for future reference, I worry that we
  may be giving them more information than they can digest in a day.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most consistent bits of feedback we got was that people
  really like doing group exercises like the code review exercise on
  day 1. Our Python lessons had little in the way of exercises,
  especially on day 2, but with these workshops there is always a
  balancing act between having exercises and trying to cover lots of
  material. (I'd like to experiment with multiple choice questions and
  peer instructions as a way to intersperse quick group discussions in
  workshops. -MD)
</p>
<p>
  Overall - this workshop went very smoothly - no major issues. Thanks
  to all the instructors and helpers!
</p>
<h2>N.B. Instructor Interaction</h2>
<p>
  A number of events have culminated in me thinking about interacting
  with my fellow instructors in front of the class.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      I raised my hand a few times during Erik's Python lesson on day 1
      and when called on asked if he wanted to explain something in a
      little more detail. I stayed at the back of the room while
      speaking. At different times Erik chose to either explain, say
      that was beyond the scope of the lesson, or that we would come
      back to it later.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We had a sticky note on the first day saying: "Erik should have
      listened to Azalee". I worried that my interruptions had been
      disrespectful to Erik in the eyes of the students and possibly
      reduced his effectiveness as an instructor. [I didn't feel that
      way, but I still need to work on my engangement with the room in
      general--it's hard to read them at my current level. --Erik]
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In the Train the Trainers event at UC Davis Greg said that you
      should not interrupt fellow instructors as it splits the focus of
      students (which is already split between the instructor and the
      screen).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      There was a discussion of this at our SWC workshop
      debriefing. Here Greg also mentioned that if you are going to
      interrupt you can walk towards the front of the classroom to
      signal that you want to say something and at that point the focus
      is less split.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I believe my take away from all of this is the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Most instructor to instructor interaction in front of the class is
      good (this is not scientific just anecdotal). It can draw the
      instructor's attention to something they left out or add
      information that benefits the class.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is really important how this interaction comes about. You
      should never speak over your fellow instructor. I think ideally
      you can slowly walk towards the front with your hand up and hang
      on the sidelines until the instructor at the front of the room
      acknowledges you. This keeps the control of the lesson in the
      hands of the instructor who is leading the lesson.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Interruptions should be used sparingly. They should only clarify
      material never complicate it. If at all possible you should phrase
      your information in such a way that the instructor who is leading
      the discussion can explain it to the class. This allows the
      instructor to maintain the focus of the class and can continue to
      demonstrate their knowledge of the material that they are
      teaching.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This should be discussed before the workshop. Instructors should
      ask each other - are you ok with a interruption and how can I let
      you know that I have something to add?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Discussion beforehand also opens the door to an instructor saying
      - please don't interrupt - or to say - let me see how it goes - I
      will let you know if it's not working.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
