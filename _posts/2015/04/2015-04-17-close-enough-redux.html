  Back in October,
  we explained why <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/why-we-dont-teach-testing.html">we don't teach testing</a>
  in Software Carpentry workshops.
  In response,
  Ian Hawke has put together
  <a href="http://ianhawke.github.io/blog/close-enough.html">a really nice series of articles</a>
  about how he would test a small numerical program.
  It's great content,
  and it also shows yet again how <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>
  (formerly the IPython Notebook)
  is changing the way scientists create and share ideas.
