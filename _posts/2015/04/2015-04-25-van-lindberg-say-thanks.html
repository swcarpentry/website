  Van Lindberg,
  the chair of the Python Software Foundation,
  gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvlfTZzJ2_Q">really insightful keynote</a>
  at PyCon 2015 last week.
  In a nutshell:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The PSF's greatest challenge is that it's short of time:
      it has one full-time and three part-time employees.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      What can you do to help?
      <ul>
	<li>Say thanks to people for what they're doing.</li>
	<li>Raise up and mentor others.</li>
	<li>Persevere when trying something new. (Bonus points if you help someone out who doesn't look like you.)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      How can a new organization grow up to be the PSF?
      <ul>
	<li>Don't rush it.  (In particular, don't put too much process in place too soon.)</li>
	<li>Default to openness.</li>
	<li>Build a culture of service.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There's lots more,
  and you should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvlfTZzJ2_Q">watch the whole thing</a>,
  but I think these are good guidelines for Software Carpentry
  (and most other things, too).
