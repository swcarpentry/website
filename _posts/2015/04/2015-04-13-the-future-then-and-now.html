  Jon Udell's
  <a href="http://jonudell.net/GroupwareReport.html">Internet Groupware for Scientific Collaboration</a>
  taught me how to think about the web.
  He started work on an update a couple of months ago,

  What strikes me upon re-reading the first is how far we've come;
  upon reading the second,
  is how far we still have to go to make all of this <em>normal</em>.
  As William Gibson said,
  "The future is already here&mdash;it's just not very evenly distributed."
