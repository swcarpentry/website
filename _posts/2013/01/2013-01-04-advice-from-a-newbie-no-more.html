<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#chuang-howe.a">Adina Chuang-Howe</a> recently wrote a great blog post titled "<a href="http://adina.github.com/2012/12/29/newbie-advice/">Advice from newbie to newbie</a>", in which she gives some advice to her younger and not-yet-computationally-proficient self:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Commit (and stop whining)</li>
  <li>Use the right tool for the job</li>
  <li>Take Command</li>
  <li>Install and use a text editor</li>
  <li>Learn to manipulate files</li>
  <li>Shortcuts!</li>
  <li>Learn a programming language</li>
  <li>Become addicted to print statements (I'd actually say "...to a debugger", but never mind)</li>
  <li>Do something relevant</li>
  <li>Start automating</li>
</ol>
<p>and most importantly of all: "You can do it!"  The full article is great advice to anyone who's getting into computing, scientific or otherwise, and well worth reading.</p>

<p>Which raises the question: what advice would <em>you</em> give your younger self?</p>
