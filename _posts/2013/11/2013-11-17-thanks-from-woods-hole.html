  We ran a bootcamp last week at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.
  It seems to have gone well:
</p>
<blockquote>
  I just want to say that Will and Ross are rock stars.
  They may have started something big here in Woods Hole, a sort of revolution.
  They have taught us how to step back from our machines,
  think about what we are doing, and join forces with our neighbors,
  We will return to our respective projects on Monday morning in a more efficient and collaborative way.
  Thank you Software Carpentry.
