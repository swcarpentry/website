  As <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2013/11/instructor-training-in-three-days.html">announced last week</a>,
  we are offering a live version of
  our <a href="{{site.training_url}}">instructor training course</a>
  on April 28-30, 2014,
  at the Mozilla office in Toronto.
  <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/software-carpentry-instructor-training-registration-9481333925">Registration is now open</a>,
  and costs only $80 (though participants must cover their own travel and accommodation).
  Over the course of three days,
  36 participants will be introduced to ideas from educational psychology and instructional design,
  and shown how to use them to teach programming to scientists (and everyone else).
  It will be the ninth offering of the course,
  but the first done live,
  and we hope to see many of you there.
