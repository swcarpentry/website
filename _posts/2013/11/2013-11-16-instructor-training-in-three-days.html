  for information on registration.

<p>
  We are pleased to announce that we will be running a live version of
  our <a href="{{site.training_url}}">online instructor training course</a>
  on April 28-30, 2014,
  at the Mozilla office in Toronto.
  Over those three days,
  30 participants will be introduced to ideas from educational psychology and instructional design,
  and shown how to use them to teach programming to scientists (and others).
  The course will be free,
  though we will require a deposit to discourage no-shows
  and attendees will need to cover their own travel and accommodation costs.
  Registration will start in January&mdash;please keep an eye on this blog for news.
