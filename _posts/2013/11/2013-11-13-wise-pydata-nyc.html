  Software Carpentry has always focused on scientists at the graduate level and above,
  but getting people into the pipeline is even more important as getting them through it.
  Last week,
  thanks to backing from <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a> and others,
  a group of volunteers helped do just that
  by running Python workshops for high school girls
  in conjunction with <a href="http://pydata.org/nyc2013">PyData NYC</a>.
  Judging from <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/11/12/women-in-technology-workshop-at-pydata-nyc/">Julia Evans' writeup</a>,
  it was a great success.
  We look forward to seeing some of their alumni in our classes some day...
