  People volunteer to teach Software Carpentry bootcamps for
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/faq/#why-become-an-instructor">many reasons</a>.
  We're always grateful that they do,
  and would like them to get all the credit they deserve.
  Here are some of the ways instructors currently mention us in their CVs:
</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
  <li>A bullet point under "Teaching" saying, "Software Carpentry", then listing the specific bootcamps.</li>
  <li>A bullet point under "Teaching" for each bootcamp saying, "Workshop Co-Leader, Software Carpentry, [site].  Two day workshop introducing scientists to the programming skills they need to conduct their research."</li>
  <li>A line item under "Teaching" saying, "I am a member of the Software Carpentry Advisory Board, create material for the program, and organize and teach at workshops."</li>
  <li>A subsection under "Volunteering" that says:
    <blockquote>
      Software Carpentry Instructor Developer, February 2012 &ndash; present
      <ul>
	<li>Teach Python, shell, Git, and software engineering skills to scientists and engineers at bootcamps and in online sessions.</li>
	<li>Develop new instructional content.</li>

	<li>Mentoring and administration for Software Carpentry GitHub repositories.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

  All of these look good to us,
  and we're always happy to write letters of reference for people who've helped us by teaching,
  coding,
  or writing lesson materials&mdash;please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">email us</a> if we can help.
