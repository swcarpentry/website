<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>

  To help people figure out what's in and what out
  as we're <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2013/11//reorganizing.html">reorganizing our material</a>,
  I've drafted an explicit description of our scope
  inspired in part by
  <a href="http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/">AstroPy's idea of an "affiliated" package</a>,
  which is, "...an astronomy-related Python package
  that is not part of the astropy core package,
  but has requested to be included as part of the Astropy project's community."

<blockquote>
  Domain-specific tools for machine learning and computational fluid dynamics
  aren't built into LAPACK or NumPy:
  they're stored in separate repositories
  and released in their own packages.
  Similarly, domain-specific lessons don't belong in Software Carpentry.
  Instead,
  they should build on our lessons,
  just as computer vision libraries build on matrix and image libraries.
  Our examples should be drawn from biology, physics, economics, and similar disciplines
  in order to appeal to our audience,
  but everything we include must be accessible to anyone who's done freshman science.

  and Nikolay Koldunov's <a href="http://earthpy.org/">lessons on geosciences</a>
  shouldn't need to explain what loops are or how to write functions.
  Instead,
  they should be able to point to or include our explanations somehow
  so they can spend their time covering specialized topics that we don't.
  How they should do this,
  and how we can help without getting lost in over-engineering and the Semantic Web,
  are questions for our
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/119">tooling</a>
  and <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/120">metadata</a> discussion threads&mdash;we
  hope you'll join us there.
