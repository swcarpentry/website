  Hot on the heels of
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2013/11/data-science-centers.html">the announcement of three new data science centers in the US</a>
  comes this:
  <a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2013/Pages/phdnewcentres.aspx">&pound;350 million for PhD training centers</a>
  in the United Kingdom.
  One of them,
  at the University of Southampton,
  will focus on
  <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2013/nov/13_207.shtml">next-generational computational modelling</a>,
  and we're looking forward to working with
  <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/">Hans Fangohr</a>,
  <a href="http://www.personal.soton.ac.uk/ih3/">Ian Hawke</a>,
  <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/sgb">Seth Bullock</a>,
  and everyone else involved.
  Congratulations!
