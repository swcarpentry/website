  We are very pleased to announce that
  our second bootcamp for women in science and engineering
  will be held at
  <a href="http://www.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>
  on April 14-15, 2014.
  This event is a sequel to
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2013/07/wise-roundup.html">our first WiSE bootcamp</a>
  in Boston this past June,
  and we hope to once again fill three rooms with over 120 learners.
  If you are interested,
  please mark the dates in your calendar&mdash;registration will open in January.
