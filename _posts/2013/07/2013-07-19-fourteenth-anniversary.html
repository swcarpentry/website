  Fourteen years ago this October,
  I had the good fortune to attend a one-day workshop titled <em>Open Source/Open Science</em>
  at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
  A lot of the tools we work with have changed since then,
  but the central message remains the same:
  when it comes to science,
  the opposite of "open" isn't "closed" &mdash; it's "broken".
