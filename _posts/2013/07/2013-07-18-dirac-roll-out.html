Since June 2012, <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">The Software
Sustainability Institute</a> and Software Carpentry have been working
with the <a
href="http://zuserver2.star.ucl.ac.uk/dirac/home.html">DiRAC</a>
consortium to develop a "driving test" or basic software skills
aptitude test. The test is now ready to be rolled out across DiRAC.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The test is intended to take an hour and covers useful software
development skills including the shell and automation, version
control, testing, code review, using public/private keypairs and
secure shell. 
</p>
<p>
The test has been developed in close collaboration with DiRAC's
project director, Jeremy Yates, and project manager, Harpreet Dhanoa,
based at University College London, James Hetherington, head of the 
<a
href="http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/research-software-development/">Research
Software Development team</a> at UCL, and Andrew Turner at EPCC. We
adopted an iterative development approach and trialled it with 4 sets
of researchers from EPCC, The Software Sustainability Institute and
UCL (see, for example our blogs on our 
<a
href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/08/alpha-test-of-drivers-license-exam.html">first</a>
and
<a
href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2013/02/dirac-dry-run-two.html">second</a>
dry-runs).
</p>
<p>
We have now handed over the driving test and Jeremy will roll it out
across the DiRAC consortium. Training coordinators at each DiRAC
regional site will collectively run through ~70 post-doctoral research
associates by the end of September and then ~130 PhDs and 40 new users
by the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
Both Software Carpentry and The Software Sustainability Institute will
continue to work with Jeremy, and DiRAC, in evaluating the
effectiveness of the driving test. This contributes to research into
assessing the impact of software development training and in how best
to deliver training to UK researchers. We look forward to reporting on
progress.
