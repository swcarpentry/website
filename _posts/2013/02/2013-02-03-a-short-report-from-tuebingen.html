<p>Luis Figueira has posted a <a href="http://soundsoftware.ac.uk/swc-tuebingen-recap">short summary</a> of last week's bootcamp at the Max Planck Institute in Tuebingen, Germany.  Judging by the number of people who have contacted us since to ask about volunteering at the next one, it appears to have gone very well.</p>
