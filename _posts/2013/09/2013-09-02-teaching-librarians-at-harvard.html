  Last weekend,
  we ran a bootcamp at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astronomy
  aimed primarily at librarians.
  It was a bit of a new venture for us,
  and there were some hiccups
  (some things were taught too fast,
  some instructors used too much jargon),
  but overall it seems to have gone well,
  and we hope to do more like this soon.
