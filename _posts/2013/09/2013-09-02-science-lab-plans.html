  <a href="http://kaythaney.com/2013/09/01/our-plan-for-the-science-lab-version-1-0/">some thoughts about the lab's mission and plans</a>.
  Long story short,
  its focus is to improve communication and interoperability in open science&mdash;paraphrasing William Gibson,
  the future is already here,
  but the pieces don't play nicely with each other yet,
  so the lab is going to help make and strengthen social and technical connections.
  If you have thoughts on how to accelerate this,
  we'd <a href="http://kaythaney.com/2013/09/01/our-plan-for-the-science-lab-version-1-0/">like to hear from you</a>.
