  Robin Wilson,
  of the University of Southampton,
  recently posted a note on the Software Sustainability Institute's blog
  about <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-09-02-encouraging-citation-software-introducing-citation-files">CITATION files</a>.
  In brief,
  he (and we) would like to encourage scientific programmers
  to put a plain text file called CITATION
  in the root directory of each project,
  and to use it to tell readers how best to cite that software.
  The example Robin gives is:

<pre>
To cite ggplot2 in publications, please use:

H. Wickham. ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis. Springer New York, 2009.

A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is

@Book{,
    author = {Hadley Wickham},
    title = {ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis},
    publisher = {Springer New York},
    year = {2009},
    isbn = {978-0-387-98140-6},
    url = {http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/book},
}
</pre>
<p>
  This is similar in mechanism and intent to the <code>README</code>,
  <code>LICENSE</code>,
  and <code>INSTALL</code> files commonly found in open source projects,
  and while it's not a perfect solution,
  it's a pretty good one.
  So go ahead,
  write some <code>CITATION</code> files today
  and tweet your project's URL with the hash tag
  <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23citationfile">#citationfile</a>;
  we'll post some of those links here soon.
