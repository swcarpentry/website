  Almost everyone has written or needed code to accomplish a task.
  Whether it is to automate a process or create the perfect figure,
  these scripts are useful,
  yet do not always merit publication.
  However,
  sharing these more widely would save the rest of the community from repeating the effort.
</p>
<p>
  To help get all this code into the public sphere,
  the <a href="http://www.molecularecologist.com/">Molecular Ecologist blog</a>
  is starting a new series of posts:
  anyone can send in a piece describing their code,
  and we'll put it up on the blog.
  The code itself will be placed on our GitHub page for easier access.
</p>
<p>
  Submissions can be sent to <a href="mailto:molecularecologist@gmail.com">molecularecologist@gmail.com</a>
  and viewed at <a href="https://github.com/TheMolecularEcologist">https://github.com/TheMolecularEcologist</a>.
  Or if you are already on GitHub,
  join our organization to submit and maintain your code in that manner.
  More detailed information can be found on
  <a href="http://www.molecularecologist.com/2013/08/want-to-share-your-code/">the blog itself</a>.
