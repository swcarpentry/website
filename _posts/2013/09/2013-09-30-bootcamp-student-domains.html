Recently I was challenged to show that computational science is important to 
biologists, and, more importantly, that biologists care about learning how to 
develop quality software.  I am <i>not</i> a biologist.  While I find the 
subject fascinating I cannot make any broad claims on the topic or hope to speak 
for all biologists.  So I turned to Software Carpentry.
</p>
<p>
My experience teaching Software Carpentry and related bootcamps has been that 
biologists are always a significant portion of the student population.  In order
to demonstrate this I asked to have access to anonymized answers to part of 
the pre-assessment survey.
Specifically, I was interested in the "<i>Which of the following most closely 
aligns with your primary discipline?</i>" question. With a big assist from Amy 
Brown I obtained the data I was looking for.

Almost immediately, I was confronted with the problem of who exactly is a biologist, 
physicist, and so on.  The pre-assessment survey options are too fine grained for 
purposes here.  For example, I consider astrophysicist and geologists both to be 
physicists.  Furthermore, since the survey question is a check-box type the students
could select multiple options.  Their selections may span multiple domains.  
Finally, there is a pesky "Other" option which allows the students to submit 
any discipline they desire.  
This leads to the conundrum of which domain does the discipline 
"Data Analysis" go in?  All of them I hope.  This survey question certainly
does not yield a clean taxonomy.
</p>
<p>
To coarsen the data, I chose the following five domains to group disciplines 
into: physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics &amp; computer science, and 
humanities &amp; social science.  Is this grossly unfair to some disciplines? Yes.
Does it work? Double yes.  In the spirit of openness, all of the data and analysis
is available at 
<a href="https://github.com/scopatz/swc-bc-student-domains">this repository</a>.
You can also view 
<a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/scopatz/swc-bc-student-domains/master/domains.ipynb">the IPython notebook</a> 
where I did my analysis. Feel free to criticize my groupings in the comments.
</p>
<p>
The data that Amy provided me with was collected from 306 students over the 
most recent 9 or 10 bootcamps.  This is a large enough 
sample size to be able to say something meaningful about the student populous.
From <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> &amp; <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>, we can see that 
my intuition turned out to be correct.
</p>
<p>
Roughly a third of the participants in the bootcamps come from a biologically 
oriented field!  This is second only to the physics-related disciplines.  Moreover, 
the biologists far outstrip their counterparts in the other domains.  So if 
Software Carpentry bootcamps are any measure of interest in software development
best practices - and I think they are - then it is clear that the biology domain is
thriving.

These percentages sum to greater than 100% because students may select more that one discipline.
