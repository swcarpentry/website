On 21st August 2013, we'll be attending <a
href="http://www.intecol2013.org/">INTECOL13</a> in London's
Docklands. The 11th International Congress of Ecology, hosted by the
<a href="http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/">British Ecological
Society</a> and <a href="http://www.intecol.net/">INTECOL</a>, is one
of the world's premier conference for ecologists. At the invitation of
Matthew Smith of the <a
href="http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/getting-involved/special-interest-groups/computational-ecology/
">BES Computational Ecology Specialist Interest Group</a> and <a
href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/science/">Microsoft
Research</a>, Software Carpentry and <a
href="http://www.software.ac.uk">The Software Sustainability
Institute</a> have a talk and a session.

<p>
Steve Crouch will present a talk on behalf of Greg Wilson, on "better
computational practices for research". This session will highlight the
problems faced by researchers who develop software, and ecologists in
particular, including the tractability, development and
reproducibility of ecological models, and discuss possible solutions.

<p>
After runs at <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2011-06-22-what-makes-good-code-good">Effective Scientific Programming</a>,
<a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2011-12-16-what-makes-good-code-good-digital-social-research-view">Digital Social Research</a>
and <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2012-02-17-what-makes-good-code-good-and-peer-software-reviewing-dev8d">Dev8D</a>,
Mike Jackson will chair another discussion on "what makes good
code good". This session will explore what ecologists view as
good code, how ecologists learn about good code, the blockers to
producing good code and how these can be overcome, by research
leaders, institutions, funders, and ourselves.

<p>
We look forward to reporting on our experiences.
