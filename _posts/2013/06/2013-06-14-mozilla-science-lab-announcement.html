  We're very excited to announce the launch of
  the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab">Mozilla Science Lab</a>,
  a new initiative that will help researchers around the world
  use the open web to shape science's future.
  The Science Lab will foster dialog between the open web community and scientific researchers.
  Together they'll share ideas, tools, and best practices for using next-generation web solutions
  to solve real problems in science,
  and explore ways to make research more agile and collaborative.

<p>
  The project will be lead by <a href="http://kaythaney.com/">Kaitlin Thaney</a>,
  a long-time open science advocate.
  Kaitlin helped found and manage the science program at Creative Commons,
  and previously worked at Digital Science,
  a tech company focused on research tools and incubation for science startups.
  She also advises policymakers on digital infrastructure,
  data-intensive science,
  and education to make scientific research more collaborative, open, and reproducible.
