I have recently organised a bootcamp at the University of
Southampton, as part of my Software Sustainability Institute
<a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme">fellowship</a>.
I hadn't actually attended a bootcamp before (I was meant to, but
unfortunately had to cancel) so it was a little nerve-wracking doing
all of the organising - it all worked out well in the end though.
</p>

<p>
The bootcamp was primarily for students at the 
<a href="http://www.icss.soton.ac.uk">Institute for Complex Systems
Simulation</a>, from which we got around 35 students, with 15 students
from the university's 
<a href="http://cmg.soton.ac.uk/">Computational Modelling Group</a> making
up a grand total of 50 attendees. As the course was primarily designed
for the ICSS, I did a very early pre-questionnaire asking what topics
the ICSS students would like to cover - which was very much
appreciated - and this early discussion got registrations off to a
good start. In fact, we had around 20 people on the waiting list at
one point, which allowed us to easily fill up places when people
dropped out. In the end we had 48 people registered on the day, of
whom 42 attended.  
</p>
<p>
There were some changes in the team of instructors during the planning
of the bootcamp, as one instructor dropped out part way through the
planning process, but we still managed to keep going with the same
topics we had planned, and were instructed by Nelle Varoquaux and
James Morrison. The ICSS at Southampton kindly paid expenses for the
instructors, and provided us with very tasty buffet lunches as well as
coffee/cakes for the morning and afternoon breaks.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the final day we did the traditional good-point,
bad-point questions around the room and got the useful comments below:

software engineering (and not assuming I release libraries etc)</td>

screens?</td>

copying and pasting from Etherpad</td>

carpentry online lessons</td>

<p>
From the post-event questionnaire, 100% of respondants found the boot
camp enjoyable, useful and will apply some of the techniques in their
work. 
</p>
<p>
The room we managed to book for the bootcamp (85 / 2207 for anyone
reading this in future before another bootcamp at Southampton) worked
very well. It was large enough to fit all of the attendees in, was air
conditioned, had plenty of space for helpers to move around, and had
space outside for people to mill around during the lunch and coffee
breaks. We deliberately re-arranged the room to have a large central
aisle with tables either side, so that the helpers only had a maximum
of four people to squeeze past to help someone, and this was very
effective. The only improvement to the room would have been having two
projectors - we did bring a spare projector and use it, but it was so
dim that we decided we couldn't really use it for important things
(hence putting the Etherpad on there).
</p>
<p>
As with all bootcamps, we struggled with a wide mix of students coming
to the course - some of which had very little (if any) experience with
Python. However, we managed to keep most people with us, and I don't
think anyone didn't turn up for the second day. We had a lovely
comment that "I am really pleased with myself that I stayed until 5pm
and am coming back tomorrow - so that is good news, thanks!". In fact,
that comment came through the brilliant red/green post-it note
feedback mechanism. We used these post-it notes in the standard
'notification'-type way (where students stick a red post-it on their
laptop when they have problems, and a green when they have done the
exercise), but we also got students to write on the post-it notes
before each break in a session, listing a good thing that they really
understood on the green post-it, and something they were struggling
with on the red post-it note. This was really useful for the
instructors, and we were able to tailor the subsequent part of these
sessions to answer the specific questions that were raised. 
</p>
<p>
In terms of specific things that might help future bootcamp
organisers and instructors:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
There were significant problems with the setup and installation
procedures. Many people didn't do this before-hand, or tried to do it,
found it difficult and then gave up. This caused significant problems
in the first session, with some people managing to get going with the
shell session, and others still struggling with the setup. There are
various things that can be done about this: 
<ul>
<li>
Ensure there is double the amount of time you think you'll need
available at the start of the first day for setup issues.
</li>
<li>
Email people the day before asking them to come early if they have had
setup problems.
</li>
<li>
Make sure you have a VM image on a pen-drive for students who have
issues (I forgot to do this...).
</li>
<li>
More generally: I think we need to significantly re-write the
installation instructions on the Software Carpentry webpages. A number
of students said that they tried to follow them but that they were
<i>very</i> confusing and made <i>very</i> little sense. One student
commented that we really need to do a 'Step by Step Installation for
Dummies' guide which goes from nothing to everything, and shows how to
check if things are installed. I agree, although this will be
difficult to make applicable for every system.
</li>
<li>
I felt a bit embarassed that we dropped James (who was instructing for
the first time) into these setup problems on the first day, I think
the first session should ideally be run by an experienced instructor
who will be more familiar with dealing with these problems.
</li>
<li>
Students were asked to clone the git branch for the bootcamp at the
beginning of the first session - before they had been taught git! They
found this very difficult, and many people didn't get it properly
downloaded for a while. The other problem is that doing a standard
'git clone URL' will download <i>all</i> of the data for that
repository (including all branches, all of the history etc) - which
took a LONG time when 50 people were doing it at the same time. One
student very reasonably asked why we don't provide the bootcamp
material as a simple zip file. 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The red/green post-it system for feedback at the breaks in each
session was wonderful, and should be used more widely. 
</li>
<li>
It is amazing how much a good food plus coffee and cakes can
help...although it is very important to make sure dietary requirements
are taken care of (even if the catering organisation said they would
provide it ok, they didn't). 
</li>
<li>
We tried to make a more flexible final session by pointing students to
the Software Carpentry resources, and the resources from the boot
camp, and asking them to work on whatever they wanted and have lots of
discussions about issues and general questions with the
instructors. However, many students took this as a cue to leave (which
I hadn't expected!) and so I had to hurridly give my final
presentation.
</li>
<li>
I think a number of students found the final presentation which
brought it all together quite useful - but I altered the 'standard'
Software Carpentry one quite a bit, to add in ways to combine all of
what we'd learnt (eg. shell scripts as git hooks to run automated
tests). This new presentation is in the 
<a href="{{site.github_url}}/boot-camps/tree/2013-06-southampton">2013-06-southampton</a> 
branch of the bootcamp's repository.
</li>
<li>
Nelle's reproducible research session was very much appreciated by
people, particularly the use of makefiles for reproducible research.
</li>
<li>
A number of students found the testing session rather frustrating for
a number of reasons including: too much Python coding, more time spent
on it than they thought it needed, not understanding the point for
people who don't write libraries etc.
</li>
<li>
One major suggestion from a number of people was to make all of the
examples inter-linked, and to present the bootcamp as one big story,
showing how you'd use these various tools and techniques to do 'good
reproducible computational science'. This is a lovely idea, but I can
imagine it would be very difficult - however, I may blog about it in
future.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think the structure of the bootcamp worked very well, particularly
as we had a lot of time allocated for each session, so we could go
into more depth but also not worry too much about time. However, the
real stars of the show were the instructors - and they deserve huge
thanks. I think it is appropriate to finish with a comment from one of
the students on one of their green post-it notes:
</p>
<blockquote>
Thank you for selecting such knowledgable people to instruct this course!
</blockquote>
