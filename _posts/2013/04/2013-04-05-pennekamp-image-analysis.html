  I am a alumni of the bootcamp in Paris in June 2012.
  I have been working on a paper on digital image analysis
  for experimental studies in ecology and evolution
  working with small-scale model organisms such as aquatic microbes, insects or fish.
  Besides explaining the principles of image analysis,
  we provide scripts in Python, R and ImageJ
  so people can directly use the methods.
  The paper has now been <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12036/abstract">published</a>,
  and I'd like to share our success with the Software Carpentry community.

<p><em>Implementing image analysis in laboratory-based experimental systems for ecology and evolution: a hands-on guide</em></p>

<p>
  The paper explains the basic ideas behind digital image analysis such as 
  different approaches for image segmentation and how to create an 
  automated and validated workflow to extract object counts and morphology 
  measurements on thousands of images. This facilitates quite a bit the 
  work of biologists which otherwise spend hours counting and measuring 
  objects manually on a microscope. Additionally, we provide scripts 
  written in Python, R and the macro language of ImageJ so everyone can 
  embrace the presented methods and perform image analysis on a set of 
  test images (and then on his own set of images). A Software Carpentry 
  bootcamp introduced me to Python programming in general and some of the 
  libraries used (scikits-image) and I also enjoyed quite a bit of your 
  tutorials which helped me to write the scripts.
