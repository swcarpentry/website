  Caitlyn Pickens
  (a graduate student at Michigan State who is interning with us this summer)
  has just <a href="http://michigancomputes.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/validity-when-evaluating-learning/">posted an article</a>
  about the validity of different kinds of assessment.
  Caitlyn's goal is to build some tools we can use
  to gauge the impact Software Carpentry is having&mdash;like almost everything involving human beings,
  it turns out to be more complicated than it first appears,
  and her post helps lay out the background knowledge needed to understand why.
