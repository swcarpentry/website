<p>Of the 29 people who responded to a brief questionnaire before a recent bootcamp, we have:</p>
<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr><td align="right">18</td><td>graduate students</td></tr>
  <tr><td align="right">4</td><td>postdocs</td></tr>
  <tr><td align="right">4</td><td>staff</td></tr>
  <tr><td align="right">1</td><td>faculty member</td></tr>
  <tr><td align="right">1</td><td>general public</td></tr>
  <tr><td align="right">1</td><td>special student</td></tr>
</table>
<p>They describe their current expertise as:</p>
<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr><td align="right">1</td><td>master</td></tr>
  <tr><td align="right">10</td><td>have written a few programs</td></tr>
  <tr><td align="right">17</td><td>have written a little code</td></tr>
  <tr><td align="right">1</td><td>has no programming experience</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Here's how they thought they could do on some simple tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write a short program to read a file containing columns of numbers separated by commas, average the non-negative values in the second and fifth columns, and print the results.
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <tr><td align="right">11</td><td>could do it easily</td></tr>
      <tr><td align="right">15</td><td>could probably struggle through</td></tr>
      <tr><td align="right">3</td><td>wouldn't know where to start</td></tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>In a directory with 1000 text files, create a list of all files that contain the word "Drosophila", and redirect the output to a file called <code>results.txt</code>.
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <tr><td align="right">12</td><td>could do it easily</td></tr>
      <tr><td align="right">10</td><td>could struggle through</td></tr>
      <tr><td align="right">7</td><td>wouldn't know where to start</td></tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>Check out a working copy of a project from version control, add a file called <code>paper.txt</code>, and commit the change.
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <tr><td align="right">3</td><td>could do it easily</td></tr>
      <tr><td align="right">4</td><td>could struggle through</td></tr>
      <tr><td align="right">22</td><td>wouldn't know where to start</td></tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>A tab-delimited file has two columns: the date, and the highest temperature on that day. Produce a graph showing the average highest temperature for each month.
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <tr><td align="right">19</td><td>could do it easily</td></tr>
      <tr><td align="right">0</td><td>could struggle through</td></tr>
      <tr><td align="right">10</td><td>wouldn't know where to start</td></tr>
    </table>
  </li>
</ol>
