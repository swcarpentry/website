<p>
  On June 24-25, 2013,
  Software Carpentry will run a computing skills bootcamp in Boston
  for women in science, engineering, and medicine.
  With three rooms and six instructors,
  it will be one of the biggest events we've ever done.
</p>
<p>
  bootcamps alternate short tutorials with hands-on practical exercises.
  Learners are taught tools and concepts they can use immediately
  to increase their productivity and improve confidence in their results.
  Topics covered include the Unix shell,
  version control,
  basic Python programming,
  testing,
  and debugging&mdash;the
  core skills needed to write, test and manage research software.
</p>
<p>
  This bootcamp is open to women at all stages of their research careers,
  from graduate students, post-docs, and faculty
  to staff scientists at hospitals and in the public, private, and non-profit sectors.
  Registration is only $20;
  to sign up, or find out more, please visit
  the <u>registration page</u>
  or email <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">{{site.contact}}</a>.
  And if you would like to volunteer to help during practical sessions on either or both days,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact us</a> as well.
</p>
<p>
  This bootcamp has been made possibly by support from
  the <a href="http://sloan.org">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a>,
  the <a href="http://www.mozillafoundation.org">Mozilla Foundation</a>,
  <a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>,

  and several generous individuals.

    Armed with a single introductory C++ course, I did a master's degree and
    several years of consulting work on spatial simulation models before taking
    Software Carpentry. Long, slow, frustrating experiences left me well prepared
    to appreciate this course. What has changed? I work more quickly, and re-use
    my own code; I find more errors, and spend less time fixing them; I trust my
    results more; I don't mind revisiting and revising old work; collaborators and
    potential employers are more impressed; and I'm happier.
