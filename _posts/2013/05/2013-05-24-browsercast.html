  <a href="http://blog.codekills.net/">David Wolever</a>
  (a freelance developer here in Toronto)
  has released the first version of BrowserCast,
  an IPython Notebook plugin that allows you to synchronize a voice-over soundtrack with
  a step-by-step reveal of a notebook,
  thereby creating a screencast-style presentation <em>in the browser</em>.
  He has created two traditional (video) screencasts showing
  <a href="http://youtu.be/OAIyHgbi5rM">why BrowserCast is cool</a>
  and
  <a href="http://youtu.be/UhHRuPPFWtE">how to create a presentation with BrowserCast</a>,
  but if you really want to get a feel for it,
  you can use the <a href="http://wolever.github.io/browsercast/">bookmarklet</a>
  that lets you give it a try with your own notebooks,
  or <a href="https://github.com/wolever/browsercast">grab the plugin from GitHub</a>
  and take it for a test drive.

  Regular readers will know that I've been wanting something like this for a while.
  Long story short,
  the stuff that looks like text in a conventional screencast
  is actually just pixels painted to look like text;
  your favorite search engine can't look for the name of a particular class,
  you can't copy and paste code examples,
  and accessibility aids can't read it aloud.
  David Seifried and Jeremy Banks took a run at solving this problem last year
  using slideshows as their starting point
  (see <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/02/slide-drive.html">this post</a> for an early progress report,
  and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/07/ipython-notebook-towtruck-etherpad-slide-drive-win.html">this one</a>
  for a later discussion of why our lives would all be better if someone made this work).
  BrowserCast comes closer than anything ever has to what I've been dreaming of;
  if and when we can add in-browser drawing
  (by integrating an SVG sketching tool into the IPython Notebook),
  I think it will be a world-beating platform for teaching people how to program.
  So check it out,
  and give David feedback&mdash;he'd love to hear from you.
