<p>
  The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab/Calls">Science Lab meeting</a>
  is our community call, running every four weeks,
  highlighting what we're up to as well as work of the community relevant to science and the web. 
  Join us to hear more about current projects,
  ways you can get involved, 
  and discuss issues around open science.
</p>
<p>
  On this call,
  we're thrilled to welcome a number of key community members who will be telling us more about their work.
  We'll be hearing from <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lazowska/">University of Washington's Ed Lazowska</a>,
  part of the recently announced <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2013/11/data-science-centers.html">Moore/Sloan grant</a>
  funding three major US universities to look at changing the culture regarding data science.
</p>
<p>
  We'll also be joined by <a href="http://arfon.org/">Arfon Smith</a>
  (co-founder of <a href="http://www.zooniverse.org">Zooniverse</a> who recently started at <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>)
  and <a href="http://twitter.com/figshare/">Mark Hahnel</a> (of <a href="http://figshare.com">figshare</a>)
  who will be speaking about our newest project at the Science Lab on code as a research object.
  They'll be giving us a look at where we've come with data,
  and how that may map to integrating code into the scholarly workflow.
</p>
<p>
  Have a project, idea or blog post you'd like to share relevant to open science?
  <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/sciencelab-calls-dec12">Add it to the etherpad</a> (see line 66).
</p>
<p>
  Mark your calendars, and help us spread the word.
  Our first call (rather literally) broke the dial-in line
  (<a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/sciencelab-calls-nov14">check out the amazing etherpad here</a>),
  maxing out on participants.
  We've troubleshooted the line and upped the limit&mdash;let's see if we can replicate last month's participation!

  We hope you'll join us.
