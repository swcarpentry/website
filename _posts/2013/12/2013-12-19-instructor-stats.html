  We recently wrapped up the latest round of instructor training,
  which makes this a good time to look at how well the program is doing.
  Here are stats on the first six rounds:

<table class="table table-striped">
<tr><th>Round</th><th>Enrolled</th><th>Completed</th></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>20</td><td>11 (55%)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>25</td><td>11 (44%)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>13</td><td>2 (18%)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4</td><td>27</td><td>13 (48%)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>5</td><td>45</td><td>12 (25%)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>6</td><td>41</td><td>18 (44%)</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Overall</th><td>171</td><td>67 (39%)</td></tr>
  </table>
<p>
  A 39% completion rate would be nothing to brag about in a regular class,
  but it's several times higher than most online courses achieve.
  57 people are currently taking part in our seventh cohort,
  69 are due to start in mid-January,
  and registration will open next month for a
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2013/11/instructor-training-in-three-days.html">live three-day version</a>
  of the course in Toronto in April.
  If you'd like to take part,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">mail us</a> to sign up.
