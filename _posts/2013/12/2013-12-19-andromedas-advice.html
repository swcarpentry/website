  We're very pleased to announce that
  <a href="http://andromedayelton.com">Andromeda Yelton</a>
  will be coming to Toronto in mid-January
  to help teach a <a href="http://gvwilson.github.io/2014-01-13-toronto/">bootcamp for librarians</a>.
  Her advice on how to do this is
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mm9nNuzLiHVB15PxQGAK5kP0VUymq8loQFq6iaLUgcM/edit?pli=1">online</a>,
  along with her
  <a href="http://andromedayelton.com/blog/2013/11/25/reflecting-on-introduction-to-python-for-librarians/">reflections</a>
  on what she's learned herself.
  There's lots of good stuff in both,
  and we're looking forward to lots of new ideas.
