  The <a href="http://mozillascience.org/">Mozilla Science Lab</a>'s newest project
  extends our existing work around <strong>code as a research object</strong>,
  exploring how we can better integrate code and scientific software into the scholarly workflow.
  The project will build and test a bridge to allow users
  to push code from their <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> repository
  to <a href="http://figshare.com">figshare</a>,
  providing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">Digital Object Identifier</a>
  for the code.
  We will also be working on a best practice standard
  (like <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v29/n4/abs/ng1201-365.html">MIAME</a> for code)
  so that each research object has sufficient documentation to make it possible to meaningfully use.

  And please join us for our
  <a href="http://mozillascience.org/join-our-next-community-call-december-12-11-et/">December 12 community call</a>,
  where we'll be talking with Ed Lazowska about the newly-announced data science centers,
  and with Arfon Smith and Mark Hahnel about this project.
