 On the 3rd of December, Software Carpentry returned to Edinburgh with
 <a href="http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk">EPCC</a> hosting a bootcamp as
 part of its involvement in both the <a
 href="http://www.training.prace-ri.eu/">PRACE Advanced Training
 Centre</a> and <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">The Software
 Sustainability Institute</a>.

<p>
 We had 34 attendees, half from Edinburgh and Glasgow and half from
 across the UK, with one attendee from Rutgers University. They
 included researchers from a wide range of disciplines: physics,
 engineering, chemistry and life sciences, earth sciences, medicine
 and space sciences, and humanities and social sciences. About half
 the attendees were PhD students, while the rest were senior
 researchers and academics.
</p>
<p>
 My EPCC colleague Mario Antonioletti and I instructed on the boot
 camp with assistance from fellow EPCCers Amy Krause, Alistair Grant,
 Arno Proeme, Dominic Sloan-Murphy and David Scott. We were joined by
 Martin Jones from Edinburgh's School of Biological Sciences.
</p>
<p>
 During the bootcamp we provided a hands-on introduction to version
 control and Git, scientific programming in Python (the numpy, scipy
 and matplotlib libraries), good programming practice and testing.
</p>
<p>
 As is traditional on bootcamps, we went round the room to see what
 the attendees thought were the good points and bad points, so delivery
 can be improved (via a form of iterative development!) in future:

 On a personal note, after battling in the past with Cygwin to install
 a shell, Git and Python and its scientific packages onto my laptop,
 using <a href="http://msysgit.github.com/">Git Bash</a> and <a
 href="http://continuum.io/downloads.html">Anaconda</a>, the
 all-in-one scientific Python installer, worked like a dream!
</p>
<p>
 EPCC plans on running bootcamps next year as part of its user and
 computational science and engineering support for <a
 href="http://archer.ac.uk/">ARCHER</a>, the UK's new national HPC
 service for academic research.
