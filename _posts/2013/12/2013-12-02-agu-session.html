  The session will cover topics such as the role of software in research,
  its influence on researchers' productivity and innovation,
  best practice for sharing and attribution,
  and computing training for scientists.
  The session was proposed by four <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme">SSI Fellows</a>:
  Kayla Iacovino, Allen Pope, Melody Sandells, and Robin Wilson
  (who organised a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2013/06/soton-feedback.html">Software Carpentry bootcamp in Southampton</a> earlier this year).
  The American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting is a prestigious meeting, which attracts over 20,000 attendees,
  making it one of the world's largest conferences.
  The session will focus on three main themes:
  Collaboration Strategies and Technologies,
  Software Training for Researchers and Code Reuse,
  and Sharing and Publishing.
  The session is interactive,
  so there is flexibility to accommodate the audience's suggestions and any interesting points that are raised.
