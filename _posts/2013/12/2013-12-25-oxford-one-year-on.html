  <a href="http://philipwfowler.wordpress.com/2013/12/19/the-oxford-software-carpentry-boot-camp-one-year-on/">a nice study</a>
  of the impact last year's Software Carpentry bootcamp at Oxford had
  on its participants.
  The key finding for me is that 10 of the 13 respondents to his survey
  agreed or strongly agreed with the statement,
  "A year on, the workshop really encouraged me to change how I do my research."
  If you'd like to help us gather similar information from participants at other bootcamps,
