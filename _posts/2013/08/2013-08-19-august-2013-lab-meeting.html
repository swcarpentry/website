<p>
  We will have an online lab meeting on Thursday, August 22, 2013
  to discuss changes to the website,
  plans for the coming few months,
  and common questions that really ought to be answered in the FAQ
  or somewhere else.
  Everyone is welcome to join in;
  to do so,
  head over to <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-labmeeting">this Etherpad</a>
  at either 11:00 or 19:00 Toronto time,
  and hop on the conference call described there as well.
  (We're holding the same meeting twice to accommodate different time zones;
  please try to sign in a few minutes before the top of the hour
  so that we can start more or less on time.
  Please also check the <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html">World Clock Meeting Planner</a>
  to see when the times listed are for you.)
