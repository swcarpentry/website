<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>Our two-day bootcamps are working well, but that doesn't mean they're the best&mdash;or only&mdash;way to teach basic computing skills to scientists.  We've been kicking around other ideas recently, and we'd welcome your input as well.</p>
<p><strong>Become part of a regular university course.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the first few days of a course to teach Software Carpentry stuff, and the rest to teach "computational methods in [XYZ]".</li>
  <li>Counter-argument: SWC doesn't really fit a traditional lecture format, but can fit with in-class projects and discussions, follow-me tutorials, etc.</li>
  <li>And any course that includes SWC will have to be a fairly special and overly interactive course.</li>
</ul>
<p>We <em>have</em> experimented at Columbia with running a two-day bootcamp at the start of a regular course, followed by 2 hours/week for the remainder of the semester&mdash;we should be able to report back on how well it works by April or May.</p>
<p><strong>Offer a two-week residential course.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Some people think a week or two of full time work is enough time to turn a neophyte into a skilled practitioner.</li>
  <li>Others think that is virtually impossible without several hundred hours of homework, but (a) we <em>can</em> accelerate that process and (b) if people already have some basic scripting, we can accelerate it further.</li>
  <li>Either way, this would have to include time for students to apply ideas to their own research problems.</li>
  <li>For example, our Trieste bootcamp last year involved one week of Software Carpentry and one week of applying those new skills to the students' actual research projects.
    <ul>
      <li>Helping students apply this to their work at the end of the intensive-learning-period was super awesome.</li>
      <li>But participants also may have done well because they were carefully selected.</li>
      <li>And it costs a lot more to implement, both in money and in instructors' and learners' time.</li>
    </ul>
    This may basically come down to a "many but shallow vs. deep but few" argument.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Variations on this idea include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As a course requirement of first year of PhD</li>
  <li>As part of a domain-specific summer school</li>
  <li>90 minute sessions on a specific topic taught  during a conference.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to keep people engaged <em>after</em> bootcamps?</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Offer a robust set of links to online communities by domain.</li>
  <li>Show people where and how to get help online:  "how to ask a question online so that you'll get the answer you need.".</li>
  <li>Point people to hackerspaces: many professional software developers, people are motivated to share and learn, and love scientists.</li>
  <li>Online office hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've also thought about creating an online community using Facebook, Piazza, Stack Exchange, or a combination of mailing lists and Google groups.  However:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We tried this with a self-hosted forum in the fall of 2010 and the winter of 2011, with very little uptake (despite active instructors).</li>
  <li>Does keeping the community small (just SWCers) encourage the timid folks to participate more than they would on something like StackExchange?</li>
  <li>We need a large population to generate enough conversation to make it worth coming back to.</li>
  <li>All the answers are out there (e.g., on StackExchange), people just need to know how to find them.</li>
  <li>Will scientists actually use any of this? The whole mailing list model is foreign to many.</li>
</ul>
