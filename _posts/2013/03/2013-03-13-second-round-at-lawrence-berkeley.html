<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>Last week we finished up our second workshop at Lawrence Berkeley Lab. This 
time around, we tried a more free-form version of the feedback exercise in 
which students live-typed their feedback into an <a href="http://etherpad.mozilla.org">Etherpad</a>
at the end of each day. This went very well, as 
it gave us time to gather unique comments, get a rough idea of the amount of 
support for each comment, and to respond to some of the comments in real time. 
We asked three questions: what was good, what was bad/confusing, and what we 
didn't do or talk about that we should have.</p>

<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction to python and how to install things with command lines</li>
  <li>Understanding python objects, classes, functions, methods, etc.</li>
  <li>Thinking about how to structure the directories for a project</li>
  <li>Hearing how regular Python users use Python (+1)</li>
  <li>Just getting finally to write some .py code!</li>
  <li>Real world example-driven exercises</li>
  <li>Knowledge of helpful data types in Python</li>
  <li>iPython notebook and Etherpad are amazing (+1)</li>
  <li>The party on the Etherpad !!!!! (+1 +1) [Ed: the students had some fun "passing notes" in the Etherpad]</li>
  <li>Patient, fast, specific help (+1)</li>
  <li>An explanation of git from people who use git (+1 +1 +1)</li>
  <li>Inside structure of git</li>
  <li>You put a lot of things in my brain in a very short time (+1)</li>
  <li>Standalone scripts is my new goal for my code!</li>
  <li>Start thinking about how to test code for reusability</li>
  <li>Danish and coffee / snacks / food juice</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Bad or Confusing</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Python version issues, especially multiple Python versions on same system (+1 +1 +1)</li>
  <li>Relationship between Anaconda/IPython/Enthought/system Python</li>
  <li>Use of iPython Notebook vs console, roles in real-world code development (+1)</li>
  <li>Glossary/handout on Python would have been helpful for beginners</li>
  <li>Most of the Unix tutorial was extremely basic (+1 +1 +1) [Ed: There were two follow ups to this comment in which students said they needed the basic tutorial badly.]</li>
  <li>Worrying about whether to abandon perl and R for python - then I'd have to start the learning curve all over.</li>
  <li>Too fast for beginners, but noticed that others were bored (+1)</li>
  <li>Not enough 'signposting' during talks/lessons</li>
  <li>It's over now :\</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Things We Didn't Do or Talk About But Should Have</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Online "getting started with Unix" tutorial before class (+1 +1 +1)</li>
  <li>Making and annotating/labelling plots, more Matplotlib (+1 +1)</li>
  <li>Discussion of computational and memory efficiency</li>
  <li>"Best practices" for developing and maintaining code (+1 +1 +1 +1)</li>
  <li>Fitting data (+1 +1)</li>
  <li>How to share code, etc. with those who don't use version control</li>
  <li>Working with specific types of data (ie, DNA)</li>
  <li>More about modules and importing, common bugs, etc.</li>
  <li>Is there a better way to find help than google and stackoverflow?</li>
  <li>Overhead when working with extremeley large data sets</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to Shreyas Cholia and to instructors Matthew Brett, Cindee Madison, and Ariel Rokem and helpers Paul Ivanov and Matt Terry.</p>
