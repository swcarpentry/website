<p>HPCWire has run <a href="http://www.hpcwire.com/hpcwire/2011-07-18/software_carpentry_revisited.html">an interview with me</a> about Software Carpentry (a follow-up to one they did several years ago).  Regular readers will have seen the main points before, but I hope it's a good summary of the current state of play, and of what's wrong with equating "scientific computing" and "high performance computing".</p>
