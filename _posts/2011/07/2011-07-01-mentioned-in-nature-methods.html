<p>A recent article in <em>Nature Methods</em> by Jeffrey Perkel titled "<a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v8/n7/full/nmeth.1631.html">Coding your way out of a problem</a>" makes mention of Software Carpentry.  Elsewhere, Mike Croucher has written a nice article called "<a href="http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=3586">In defense of inefficient scientific code</a>", which makes many of the same points we've been making here.</p>
