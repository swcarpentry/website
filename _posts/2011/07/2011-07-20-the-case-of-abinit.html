<p>The latest issue of <em>Computing in Science &amp; Engineering</em> has a good article by Yann Pouillon, Jean-Michel Beuken, Thierry Deutsch, Marc Torrent, and Xavier Gonze titled "<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F5992%2F5678558%2F05678567.pdf%3Farnumber%3D5678567&amp;authDecision=-203">Organizing Software Growth and Distributed Development: the Case of Abinit</a>" (unfortunately behind a pay wall).  It describes the infrastructure and practices used to manage Abinit, a half-million line open-source program.  It's a lot more engineering than most teams need, but it provides a lot of insight into what small projects might grow into.  If anyone would like to do a similar paper about what a smaller-scale team uses, it would be a welcome counterpoint.</p>
