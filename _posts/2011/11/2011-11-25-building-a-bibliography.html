<p>With help from several of our regular readers, we have assembled a <a href="{{site.filesurl}}/bib/software-carpentry.bib">bibliography</a> of research related to software engineering and computational science to go with our recommended reading list for students. We hope you find it useful, and we would welcome corrections and additions.</p>
