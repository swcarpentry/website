<p>Carly Strasser, of the Digital Curation for Excel Project, has <a href="http://dcxl.cdlib.org/?p=287">posted some ideas</a> about new features that could be added to Excel to make it more useful for scientists. In brief, the list is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate metadata.</li>
<li>Generate a data citation for the data file.</li>
<li>Check the spreadsheet for export compatibility.</li>
<li>Link to archive services.</li>
</ol>
<p>Feedback and suggestions would be welcome...</p>
