<p>Prakash Prabhu and others recently published "<a href="http://liberty.princeton.edu/Publications/sc11_survey.pdf">A Survey of the Practice of Computational Science</a>" based on information from 114 researchers at Princeton University. The emphasis is different from that of the survey Hannay and others (including me) did in 2008-09, but the findings are broadly similar.</p>
