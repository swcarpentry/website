<p>Prof. <a href="http://risa.stanford.edu/">Risa Wechsler</a> writes from Stanford:</p>
<p>We are teaching a course at Stanford this term inspired by Software Carpentry.  The course, "Practical Computing for Scientists", will be a Student Initiated Course, led by two physics undergrads (former summer research students with my group)&mdash;the course will be targeted at physics undergrads with a bit of programming experience to prepare them for summer research, but we expect participation from undergrads from other fields and some grad students and postdocs as well.  I am hopeful that we will be able to keep this going as a regular student-led course with richer material as it develops.  We expect that we will use some of your materials as well as some materials developed here.</p>
<p>The website for the course is <a href="http://physics91si.stanford.edu/">http://physics91si.stanford.edu/</a>, where you can find the syllabus and the preliminary handouts.  We start tomorrow&mdash;it's a 10 week course.  We'll be happy to keep you posted on how it all goes if you are interested.</p>
