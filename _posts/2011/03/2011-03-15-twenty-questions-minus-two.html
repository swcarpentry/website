<p>Following up on last week's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2011/03/musing-about-reorganization.html">musings about reorganizing the course</a>, we've drawn up eighteen questions that we think cover the reasons people come to this course. That leaves us two short of the traditional twenty: what would <em>you</em> add to this list?</p>
<ol>
<li>How can I automate this task?</li>
<li>How can I read/control hardware?</li>
<li>How can I control my program?</li>
<li>How do I count things?</li>
<li>How can I clean up this data?</li>
<li>How can I get insight into my data?</li>
<li>How do I track down bugs in my program?</li>
<li>How can I parse this legacy data file?</li>
<li>How can I save data so that I can read it later?</li>
<li>How can I tell if my program is working correctly?</li>
<li>How can I make this program easier to use?</li>
<li>How can I use remote machines?</li>
<li>How can I reuse this legacy program?</li>
<li>How can I share my work with others?</li>
<li>How can I make my program faster?</li>
<li>How can I make my code easier to reuse?</li>
<li>How can I keep track of my work?</li>
<li>How can I plug my code into a framework like Galaxy or Taverna?</li>
</ol>
