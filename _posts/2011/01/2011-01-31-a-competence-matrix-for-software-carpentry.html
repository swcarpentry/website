<p>Last summer, we tried to create a concept map showing how the big ideas in Software Carpentry related to each other. We weren't satisfied with it, so we set it aside. With our first anniversary coming up in three months, though, it's time to revisit the idea of a high-level overview of the course. To that end, I have posted a first attempt at a competence matrix that organizes skills into levels. Please leave comments on that page telling me what's wrong or missing.</p>
