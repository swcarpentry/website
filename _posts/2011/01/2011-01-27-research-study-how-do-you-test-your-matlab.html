<p>Have you ever wondered how scientists test their code? We have, and we'd like you to help us find out. If you use MATLAB, please have a look at our new research project&mdash;and please forward the link to other groups and lists where we might be able to recruit people. (Of course, we'd also welcome input from NumPy users...)</p>
