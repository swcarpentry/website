<p>Here are summaries (slightly edited) of what people taking the course do.  There's quite a range...</p>
<ul>
<li>Stem cell biology, high-throughput screening, high-content analysis.</li>
<li>My research aims to improve the resolution of ultrasonic images created during ultrasonic inspections of thin metal sheets and metal welds though the use of digital signal processing algorithms.</li>
<li>I am currently working on learning Django to create websites.  I am also developing new course content in programming and scientific computing for a 4-year degree in GIS.</li>
<li>I do simulations of protein folding and assembly for naturally disordered proteins, the kind that are implicated in degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.  I also use dimensionality reduction techniques to find clusters in the conformation spaces of the proteins.</li>
<li>I am working on computational simulation, trying to understand the basic rules underlying protein dynamics</li>
<li>I am currently working on modeling the accretion disks of cataclysmic variable stars. I also study High Mass XRay Binaries, as well as Low Mass XRay Binaries.</li>
<li>We build and maintain global databases of fisheries statistics and analyze this information to uncover ways by which we can manage global fishery resources more sustainably.</li>
<li>Use classical molecular dynamics running on clusters and supercomputers to simulate the dynamics of individual proteins from a variety of species. In particular I focus on proteins that are embedded in the cell membranes as these are involved in many different important physiological functions e.g. transport and cell signalling.</li>
<li>Technical solutions to health and safety problems</li>
<li>I am a molecular biologist and study how different genes affect cellular phenotypes. For example, I switch off specific genes (alone or in combination) using RNAi. Typically, I perform thousands of experiments using automated liquid handling stations (robots) and record the resulting phenotypes (typically as numbers). In addition, I study how gene expression is affected using next-generation sequencing techniques (RNAseq).</li>
<li>Chemical health and safety, mostly data analysis of biological monitoring (that's urine and blood samples); creating software tools to help non-mathematicians run mathematical models (check out http://www.advancedreachtool.com/); some PBPK modelling (systems of differential equations of how chemicals move through the body).</li>
<li>We study how information about sensory stimuli is transduced, transformed, and represented in the central nervous system. At present we focus on such processes in the early visual system.</li>
<li>I am currently working on the fluid dynamics of blood droplet impact using a simulation method called Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics.  I am currently writing my code in Matlab, but may need to move to C or C++ to increase the speed of the computations.</li>
<li>Developing algorithms for neuroimaging data analysis. This involves implementation of image processing algorithms as well as statistical tools.</li>
<li>I am using statistical downscaling, which involves different types of multi-variate regressions, to predict surface observations from information provided by course resolution global climate models. Currently I am working on a project in which we are using downscaling to make future projections of the severity and likelihood of wildfire in BC. I am using R almost exclusively for this project.</li>
<li>Running hydrologic models in a unix environment. Coding in R to analyze outputs including plotting and mapping. Querying data from netcdfs and adjusting code in a statistical downscaling model that can be in c, fortran, or shell.</li>
<li>On the bioinformatics front I am comparing the evolution of the overlapping regions of the 4 genes from Hepatitis B Virus. I have used python to cut, copy and curate the sequences downloaded from Genbank to get a useable and well annotated dataset. Quite a task considering the sorry state of the data in the HBV database.</li>
<li>I do research to understand how we recognize speech and how we learn to recognize speech.  By speech recognition, I mean the mapping from the real-valued speech signal to abstract linguistic structure, like sentence structure and meaning. Methodology includes recording speakers of different languages, running psychological speech perception experiments on adults and infants, and computational modeling using machine learning algorithms.</li>
<li>My research is in the fields of hydrology and aquatic ecology. I use both field and model approaches to understand the linkages between physical and chemical hydrologic processes and the resulting impact on aquatic ecosystems.</li>
<li>At Census Bureau: Small area estimation for local government surveys. Ongoing: Statistical applications of specialized optimization methods; statistical modeling of systems of differential equations.</li>
<li>Working on a Brownian dynamics simulation of secreted protein mass transport from adherent mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) culture with perfusion of laminar flow; culturing mESCs for self-renewal or differentiation induces the secretion of many different signalling proteins.</li>
<li>I'm working with a database of location and health information for 20,000 diabetes patients in California and trying to evaluate how/if their health condition is related to their neighborhood environments. I work with GIS to characterize their access to healthy and unhealthy food resources, parks, public transportation, and other environmental factors as the data becomes available.</li>
<li>Applied Statistics with focus on Statistical Genetics.</li>
<li>Numerical simulation of an impacting drop on to a solid surface with an open cavity which has a wide range of application such as optimizing the production cost of water repellent fabrics, predicting the quality of arc welding, improving printing quality... Long story short, application of CFD in simulation of multiphase fluids processes.</li>
<li>The physics for blood flight in blood pattern analysis. Ultimately we're trying to create a program that can recognize blood stains and draw the path of their flight back to their source.</li>
<li>Attention and working memory. Currently attempting to program a useful field of view task, and an experiment that tests memory for facial features.</li>
<li>I study stem cell bioengineering, but try to bring a computational twist into things. So I'm working on models of cell proliferations and differentiation, and starting to look at some optimization methods to help with the engineering aspects of many projects within the lab.</li>
<li>Investigation into the role of international seafood trade in the expansion of the world's marine fisheries.</li>
<li>There is a lack of surface markers used to classify early cardiac progenitor cell types during differentiation from mouse embryonic stem cells.  My project is to use mass spectrometry and microarrays to identify surface markers (and other proteins) involved in the differentiation process.  Using bioinformatics and potential cell-cell interaction modeling, I would like to mine the data to extract potentially biologically relevant data pertaining to this process.</li>
<li>I'm studying the effects of ocean acidification on marine organisms. This involves constructing a lab to manipulate and monitor water chemistry. Currently, I'm trying to understand if growing under different chemical conditions results in biological materials with different structural properties.</li>
<li>I'm working on the molecular evolution of the small subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome. This is a structural informatics project dealing with analyzing 2 and 3-dimensional molecular structures and implementing energy algorithms for ribosomal RNA molecules. My current stage of work involves wetlab RNA production and functional assays on RNA fragments produced in the previous stage of analysis.</li>
<li>Implicit Large-Eddy Simulation (ILES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of transition to turbulence. Looking at both the physics of transition and the numerical methods require to model it accurately.</li>
<li>I am trying to develop a new way of stimulating paralyzed muscle.  I am using a technology called surface Functional Electrical Stimulation, which uses electricity to contract skeletal muscle.  This method is very rough and does not give precise joint torque vectors. I am looking for a way to use this technology such that the joint torque created by the contracting is precise and repeatable.</li>
<li>I'm currently studying the mechanisms by which neurons in the superior colliculus selectively respond to some visual stimuli but not others. What are the properties of these neurons and the input they receive that allow them to respond to specific sensory features?</li>
<li>My work involves statistical downscaling, a way of relating future projections made by climate models at the large scale to the scale of weather stations. Climate models work well for broad studies of the climate system but are poor at describing small scale effects such as the climates of cities because of their low resolution (grid cells with sides on the order of hundreds of kilometres). In downscaling, statistical functions are used to relate the low resolution model data to weather station observations during past times. These functions can then be used to relate future climate projections to the smaller scales, yielding projections with much greater detail.</li>
<li>Currently focusing on Application Security; identifying Cyber threats and mitigation strategies.  Would like to become more proficient in programming and design to be able to develop my own Application Security tool set.</li>
<li>A central theme in my research is the development of advanced (model-based) process control methodologies on the basis of such observed data, with a particular focus on chemical and metallurgical systems. This involves extracting complex, nonlinear regularities and trends in measured plant data. Subsequently, models are derived for the purposes of, among other, nonlinear system identification, process diagnostics, as well as insights into underlying process behavior. To this end, a number of mathematical and computational techniques are used including: * Nonparametric learning methods such as kernel methods, ensemble methods and artificial neural networks * Nonlinear time series analysis * Multivariate statistics and other exploratory data analysis techniques.</li>
<li>I primarily do Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling of combustion systems, ranging in size and application from pilot/experimental scale to industrial/power utility scale. The experimental scale work tends to be in new technologies, such as gasification and high pressure combustion, whereas the industrial scale work tends to look at design and/or operational issues in existing systems.</li>
<li>For my PhD, I investigated a type of piezoelectric ultrasonic motor. There were two parts to my research. The first part was the coupled axial-torsional vibration of pretwisted beams; I derived beam equations to model the structure and compared the predicted resonance frequencies with results from finite element method. In the second part I studied the nonlinear dynamical system of a disk bouncing on a vibrating platform as a model of the stator-rotor interaction of the motor.</li>
<li>My current area of interest is voting behavior and party strategies. I aim to combine two assumptions about voting behavior into one more general model. Such a heterogeneous voter model can tackle many empirical puzzles and explain political outcomes of democratic processes more accurate.</li>
