<p>We've started work on the high-performance computing lecture, and as part of that, we'd like to set a puzzle for our more advanced readers. We've written several versions of invasion percolation; the two of interest here use a list-based representation for the underlying grid, and a NumPy array. Run either program as:</p>
<pre>python filename.py -g -n 31 -v 100</pre>
<p><code>-g</code> turns off the end-of-run graphical display; <code>-n 31</code> tells the program to use a 31&times;31 grid; and <code>-v 100</code> tells it to initialize cells to random values between 0 and 100. Try varying the size, compare the speeds of the two programs, see if you can figure out why one is faster than the other, and then tell us:</p>
<ol>
<li>what you found, and</li>
<li>how you found it.</li>
</ol>
<p>#2 is actually more important to us than #1, since we'd like to figure out how programmers actually go about diagnosing performance problems. Please post your findings as comment on this blog <em>after</em> Wednesday, Jan 12 (to give everyone else a chance to try it out too).</p>
<p><em>Update: WordPress seems to "fix" indentation (leading white space) more or less randomly when I paste code into a &lt;pre&gt; area, so I'll link to the two files.</em></p>
