<h2>This post originally appeared on the [Software Carpentry website](https://software-carpentry.org/)</h2>
<p>The first four episodes of our lecture on object-oriented programming in Python are now available:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Basics</li>
<li>Interfaces</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
</ol>
<p>There's (lots) more to come, but early feedback on these would be very welcome.</p>
