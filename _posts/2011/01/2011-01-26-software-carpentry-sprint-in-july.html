<p>Well this was a nice birthday present: the Python Software Foundation <a href="http://pythonsprints.com/2011/01/25/sponsoring-software-carpentry-2011/">announced</a> today that they will provide some support for a Software Carpentry sprint in Toronto in July. Thanks, folks&mdash;we'll post details about what, when, and where as soon as we have them.</p>
