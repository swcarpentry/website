<p>I've been working full-time on Software Carpentry since the beginning of May 2010. As <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2010/11/hours-so-far.html">I said at the end of November</a>, progress has been steady, but we're only at 60-70% of plan. I am therefore now looking for more funding so that I can continue developing material and delivering the course online this summer and fall. I would welcome pointers to potential backers, and introductions even more. (But please, only ones that are fairly focused: "have you tried the NSF?" or "there must be companies that need this stuff!" aren't actually very useful...)</p>
