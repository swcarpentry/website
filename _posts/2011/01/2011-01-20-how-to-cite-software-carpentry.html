<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>If you are citing Software Carpentry in papers or technical reports, the web site and the 2006 article in <cite>Computing in Science &amp; Engineering</cite> are probably best; the other articles below provide other background that might also be useful. I hope to update the 2006 article some time this year, but a lot of other things are ahead of it in queue...</p>
