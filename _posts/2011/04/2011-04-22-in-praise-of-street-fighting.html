<p>Sanjoy Mahajan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Street-Fighting-Mathematics-Educated-Guessing-Opportunistic/dp/026251429X"><em>Street-Fighting Mathematics</em></a> is subtitled "The Art of Educated Guessing and Opportunistic Problem Solving".  As the author says in the introduction, "Too much mathematical rigor teaches <em>rigor mortis</em>: the fear of making an unjustified leap even when it lands on a correct result." It's only 134 pages long (including the index), but it's packed full of practical ideas for tackling mathematical problems; in a sense, it aims to train people to do the kind of rough-and-ready calculations that David MacKay deploys so effectively in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sustainable-Energy-Without-Hot-Air/dp/0954452933"><em>Sustainable Energy&mdash;Without the Hot Air</em></a>.</p>
<p>Books like this make me wonder what a computing equivalent might look like. What <em>are</em> some useful heuristics for tackling programming problems? Does it even make sense to think in those terms, given that programming mostly a non-numerical activity (our programs may push numbers around, but we don't produce them via calculation)?</p>
<p>Still pondering...</p>
