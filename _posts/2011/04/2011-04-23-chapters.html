<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>I've converted three more Software Carpentry lectures to chapter format, bringing the total to four:</p>
<ol>
<li>the shell</li>
<li>number crunching with NumPy</li>
<li>regular expressions</li>
<li>software engineering</li>
</ol>
<p>It's all CC-A licensed, and yeah, the images could be a lot better: they're just screen captures from the original PowerPoint slides, because re-doing them as SVG felt even more like <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a> than converting the text. Please let me know if this is useful.</p>
