<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>Thanks to the indefatigable <a href="http://whitelab.weecology.org/">Ethan White</a>, we have just added four more episodes on using databases with Microsoft Access:</p>
<ul>
<li>aggregating data</li>
<li>combining data with 'join'</li>
<li>nested queries</li>
<li>handling missing data</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you enjoy them.</p>
