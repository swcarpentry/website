<p>Open science, reproducible research, and better computational skills aren't necessarily connected, but in my experience, people who care about one usually care about the others as well. In that light, I just signed the "<a href="http://www.researchwithoutwalls.org/">Research Without Walls</a>" pledge: effective today,I will assist in the peer review process (as a reviewer, board/committee member, chair, editor, etc.) only for conferences, journals, and other publication venues that make all accepted publications available to the public for free via the web. If you believe that sharing ideas is the heart and soul of science, please sign up as well.</p>
