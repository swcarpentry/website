<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>As a follow-up to recent posts on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2011/02/how-to-contribute.html">how to contribute</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2011/02/what-better-looks-like.html">what better looks like</a>, and Elango Cheran's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2011/02/ask-and-ye-shall-receive.html">secure shell episode</a>, here's a specific request: we would like three episodes on systems programming, by which we mean writing programs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>manipulate files and directories (chdir, stat, etc.)</li>
<li>working with archives (tar, zip, etc.)</li>
<li>run other programs (the subprocess module in all its fearsome glory)</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical use case is writing a Python script to run a compiled legacy application a few hundred times for slightly different parameter values, putting each run's output in a separate directory that's created on the fly, and so on.  If you're interested, please get in touch &mdash; it's easier than you think.</p>
