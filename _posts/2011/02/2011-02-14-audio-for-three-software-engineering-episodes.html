<p>We've added audio (and a few images) for three of the episodes on software engineering (the introduction, agile development, and the principles of computational thinking). It's a slightly different format than most of our previous episodes, and we need to choose a better way of embedding MP3 audio in web pages, but we hope it's useful as is.</p>
