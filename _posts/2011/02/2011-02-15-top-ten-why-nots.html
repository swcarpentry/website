<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>We've had quite a few firsts and successes in the past ten months, but our biggest failure continues to be the lack of contributions from users and educators: while quite a few people are using our material, only one person has (so far) volunteered to create material for us. If that doesn't change, Software Carpentry will stagnate as soon as I have to move on to other things (which, given my lack of success in raising another round of funding, will probably happen this spring).</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Wynn Netherland recently posted a list titled "<a href="http://thechangelog.com/post/3032074343/top-ten-reasons-why-i-wont-use-your-open-source-project">Top ten reasons why I won't use your open source project</a>". It's not about contributing per se&mdash;I'll have to go back to Karl Fogel's excellent <a href="http://producingoss.com"><em>Producing Open Source Software</em></a> to start figuring that out&mdash;but it's still worth going through.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You don't have a README.</strong> We have an explanation of who this course is for and what it's about, but nothing that explains how to contribute.</li>
<li><strong>You don't include tests, specs, features, examples.</strong> Doesn't really apply.</li>
<li><strong>You have no project home page.</strong> We do.</li>
<li><strong>You need design help.</strong> I think we look OK.</li>
<li><strong>You don't have a domain name.</strong> We do.</li>
<li><strong>You don't have a Twitter account.</strong> <a href="{{site.twitter_url}}">We do</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Your licensing is unclear.</strong> <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/license/">Our license</a> is very clear and easy to find.</li>
<li><strong>You don't reach out to me.</strong> I think we pass this test.</li>
<li><strong>You don't speak about your project at conferences at meetups.</strong> We could do more; the question is where?</li>
<li><strong>You didn't submit it to the Changelog</strong>, which apparently is this week's hot "what's on in open source" blog. *shrug*</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, #1 seems like the only major gap. If we fixed this&mdash;if we wrote a "how to contribute" guide&mdash;how many of you would be interested in creating short screencasts for us? It would help your peers, and look shiny on your CV too...</p>
