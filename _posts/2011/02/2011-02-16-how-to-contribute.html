<p>Following up on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2011/02/top-ten-why-nots.html">yesterday's post</a>, I have written a short guide explaining how you can help Software Carpentry improve and grow.  Reporting bugs, suggesting changes, contributing content, or running the course yourself: they're all a lot easier than you think, and a great way to gain some experience with new kinds of teaching and learning that are becoming more important with every passing year.</p>
