<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>Our quick introduction to Python is the module I'm least happy with, so I've been thinking about how to re-design it. I've included a new outline below; comments would be very welcome.</p>
<hr />
<p>Programming is what you do when you can't find an off-the-shelf tool to do what you want</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists' needs are so specialized that there often isn't such a tool</li>
<li>Even if it exists, the cost of finding it may be too high (can't Google by semantics)</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is programming hard to teach/learn?</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying to convey three things at once:
<ol>
<li>Here's something interesting tha tyou might actually want to do.</li>
<li>Here's the syntax of whatever programming language we're using.</li>
<li>Here are some key ideas about programs and programming that will help you do things.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>#1 is what engages your interest</li>
<li>#2 is what you'll grapple with (and will need to master in order to do #1)</li>
<li>#3 is what's most useful in the long term
<ul>
<li>But it's hard or impossible to learn the general without first learning some specifics</li>
<li>And you have deadlines: getting that graph plotted is more important right now than the big picture</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will teach basic programming by example</p>
<ul>
<li>Show you small programs, then explain the things they contain</li>
<li>Also explain a few principles along the way</li>
</ul>
<p>We will use Python</p>
<ul>
<li>Widely used for scientific programming, but that's not the main reason</li>
<li>Our experience is that novices find it more readable than alternatives</li>
<li>And it allows us to do useful things before introducing advanced concepts (e.g., OOP)</li>
</ul>
<p>Will <em>not</em> start with multimedia programming, 3D graphics, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Guzdial et al have found that it's more engaging for students</li>
<li>But getting those packages installed (and for us, maintaining them) is hard work</li>
</ul>
<p>We assume that you've done some programming, in some language, at some point</p>
<ul>
<li>Have at least heard terms like "variable", "loop", "if/else", "array"</li>
<li>Quick test: can you read a list of numbers, one per line, and print the least and greatest?</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we dive in, what <em>is</em> a program?</p>
<ul>
<li>Cynical answer: "anything that might contain bugs"</li>
<li>Classic answer: "Instructions for a computer"</li>
<li>Our answer adds: "...that a human being can understand"
<ul>
<li>Takes a lot of work to turn the things we write into instructions a computer can execute</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Time to solution is (time to write code that's correct) + (time for that code to execute)
<ul>
<li>The latter halves every 18 months (Moore's Law)</li>
<li>The former depends on human factors that change on a scale of years (languages) or generations (psychology)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Programs store data and do calculations</p>
<ul>
<li>Use variables for the first</li>
<li>Write instructions that use those variables to describe the second</li>
</ul>
<p>Put the following in a text file (<em>not</em> Word) and run it</p>
<pre># Convert temperature in Fahrenheit to Kelvin.
temp_in_f = 98.6
temp_in_k = (temp_in_f - 32.0) * (5.0 / 9.0) + 273.15
print "body temperature in Kelvin:", temp_in_k
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">body temperature in Kelvin: 310.15</span></pre>
<p>Variable is a name that labels a value (picture)</p>
<p>Created by assignment</p>
<ul>
<li>[Box] versus declaration (static typing) or create-by-read (and why the latter is bad)</li>
</ul>
<p>Usual rules of arithmetic: * before +, parentheses</p>
<p>Print displays values</p>
<ul>
<li>Put text (character strings) in quotes</li>
<li>Print automatically puts a space between values, and ends the line</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Need to know it: use "5/9" instead of "5.0/9.0"</p>
<pre># Convert temperature in Fahrenheit to Kelvin.
temp_in_f = 98.6
temp_in_k = (temp_in_f - 32.0) * (5 / 9) + 273.15  # this line is different
print "body temperature in Kelvin:", temp_in_k
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">body temperature in Kelvin: 273.15</span></pre>
<p>Run interpreter, try <code>5/9</code>, get 0</p>
<ul>
<li>Shows that Python can be used interactively</li>
</ul>
<p>Integer vs. float, and what division does</p>
<p>Automatic conversion: <code>5.0/9</code> does the right thing</p>
<p>[Box] Why are so many decimal places shown in <code>5.0/9</code></p>
<hr />
<p>Need to know it: sometimes Python doesn't know what to do</p>
<pre># Try adding numbers and strings.
print "2 + 3:", 2 + 3
print "two + three:", "two" + "three"
print "2 + three:", 2 + "three"
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">2 + 3: 5 two + three: twothree 2 + three: Traceback (most recent call last): File "add-numbers-strings.py", line 5, in &lt;module&gt; print "2 + three:", 2 + "three" TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'</span></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>"2three"</code> would be sensible</p>
<p>But what about <code>"1" + 2?</code></p>
<ul>
<li>The character "1" is <em>not</em> the number 1</li>
</ul>
<p>On your own, try <code>"two" * 3</code></p>
<hr />
<p>Back to useful things</p>
<p>Computers are useful because they can do lots of calculations on lots of data</p>
<p>Which means we need a concise way to represent multiple values and multiple steps</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing out a million additions would take longer than doing them</li>
</ul>
<pre># Find the mean.
data = [1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1]
total = 0
number = 0
for value in data:
    total = total + value
    number = number + 1
mean = total / number
print "mean is", mean
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">mean is 2</span></pre>
<p>Use list to store multiple values</p>
<ul>
<li>Like a vector in mathematics</li>
</ul>
<p>Use loop to perform multiple operations</p>
<ul>
<li>Like &Sigma; in mathematics</li>
<li>But we have to break it down into sequential steps</li>
<li>And since we're doing that, have to be able to update variables's values</li>
</ul>
<p>Can trace execution step by step manually or in a debugger</p>
<ul>
<li>An important skill</li>
<li>Want to write programs so that tracing is easy</li>
<li>See what this means when we talk about functions</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Did you notice that the result in the example above is wrong?</p>
<ul>
<li>25/9 is 2, but 25.0/9.0 is 2.77777777778</li>
</ul>
<p>Problem is that total starts as an integer, we're adding integers, we wind up doing int/int (again)</p>
<p>Could fix it by initializing total to 0.0</p>
<p>Or use a function to do the conversion explicitly</p>
<pre># Find the mean.
data = [1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1]
total = 0
number = 0
for value in data:
    total = total + value
    number = number + 1
mean = float(total) / number   # this line has changed
print "mean is", mean
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">mean is 2.77777777778</span></pre>
<p>Functions do what they do in mathematics</p>
<ul>
<li>Values in, values out</li>
</ul>
<p>Spend a whole chapter on them, since they're key to building large programs</p>
<p>Right now, most important lesson is that just because a program runs, doesn't mean it's correct</p>
<ul>
<li>Could check the original program by using a smaller data set
<ul>
<li>E.g., <code>[1, 4]</code> produces 2 instead of 2.5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Writing programs so that they're checkable is a big idea that we'll return to</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Need to know it: the <code>len</code> function</p>
<pre># Find the mean.
data = [1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1]
total = 0
for value in data:
    total = total + value
mean = float(total) / len(data) # this line has changed
print "mean is", mean
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">mean is 2.77777777778</span></pre>
<hr />
<p>Need to know it: list are mutable</p>
<pre># Calculate running sum by creating new list.
data = [1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1]
result = []
current = 0
for value in data:
    current = current + value
    result.append(current)
print "running total:", result
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">data = [1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1]</span></pre>
<p>Start with the empty list</p>
<p><code>result.append</code> is a <em>method</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Like a function, but attached to some kind of object like a list</li>
<li>noun and verb</li>
<li>Important enough that we'll spend a whole chapter on this, too</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>How to double the values in place?</p>
<pre># Try to double the values in place.
data = [1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1]
for value in data:
    value = 2 * value
print "doubled data is:", data
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">doubled data is [1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1]</span></pre>
<p>New values are being created, but never assigned to list elements</p>
<p>Easiest to understand with a picture</p>
<hr />
<p>Need to know it: list indexing</p>
<p>Mathematicians use subscripts, we use square brackets</p>
<p>Index from 0..N-1 rather than 1..N for reasons that made sense in 1970 and have become customary since</p>
<ul>
<li>Python and Java use 0..N-1 (like C)</li>
<li>Fortran and MATLAB use 1..N (like human beings)</li>
</ul>
<pre># Try to double the values in place.
data = [1, 4, 2]
data[0] = 2 * data[0]
data[1] = 2 * data[1]
data[2] = 2 * data[2]
print "doubled data is:", data
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">doubled data is [2, 8, 4]</span></pre>
<p>Clearly doesn't scale...</p>
<p>Need to get all the indices for a list of length N</p>
<hr />
<p>The <code>range</code> function produces a list of numbers from 0..N-1</p>
<ul>
<li>Examples</li>
<li>Exactly the indices for a list</li>
</ul>
<p>You will almost never be the first person to need something</p>
<ul>
<li>It's probably in the language, or in a library</li>
<li>Hard part is finding it...</li>
</ul>
<pre># Double the values in a list in place
data = [1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1]
length = len(data) # 9
indices = range(length) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
for i in indices:
    data[i] = 2 * data[i]
print "doubled data is:", data
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">doubled data is: [2, 8, 4, 6, 6, 8, 6, 8, 2]</span></pre>
<hr />
<p>Fold this together by combining function calls (like \sqrt{sin(x)})</p>
<pre># Double the values in a list in place.
data = [1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1]
for i in range(len(data)):
    data[i] = 2 * data[i]
print "doubled data is:", data
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">doubled data is: [2, 8, 4, 6, 6, 8, 6, 8, 2]</span></pre>
<hr />
<p>Usually won't type in our data</p>
<p>Store it outside program</p>
<ul>
<li>[Box] Explain difference between memory, local disk, and remote disk</li>
<li>And why we don't do everything one way or the other: performance vs. cost</li>
</ul>
<pre># Count the number of lines in a file
reader = open("data.txt", "r")
number = 0
for line in reader:
    number = number + 1
reader.close()
print number, "values in file"
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">9 lines in file</span></pre>
<hr />
<p>What about mean?</p>
<pre># Find the mean.
reader = open("data.txt", "r")
total = 0.0
number = 0
for line in reader:
    total = total + line
    number = number + 1
reader.close()
print "mean is", total / number
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">Traceback (most recent call last): File "mean-read-broken.py", line 7, in &lt;module&gt; total = total + line TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'float' and 'str'</span></pre>
<p>Data in file is text, so we need to convert</p>
<hr />
<pre># Find the mean.
reader = open("data.txt", "r")
total = 0.0
number = 0
for line in reader:
    value = float(line)

reader.close()
print "mean is", total / number
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">mean is 2.77777777778</span></pre>
<p>Notice that we're using the original program as an oracle</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro: start simple, make more complex, confidence at each step</li>
<li>Con: bug in original perpetuated indefinitely</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Real-world data is never clean</p>
<p>Count how many scores were not between 0 and 5</p>
<pre># Count number of values out of range.

num_outliers = 0
for value in data:
    if value &lt; 0:         num_outliers = num_outliers + 1     if value &gt; 5:
        num_outliers = num_outliers + 1
print num_outliers, "values out of range"
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">3 values out of range</span></pre>
<hr />
<p>Need to know it: combine tests using <code>and</code> and <code>or</code></p>
<pre># Count number of values out of range.
data = [0, 3, 2, -1, 1, 4, 4, 6, 5, 5, 6]
num_outliers = 0

        num_outliers = num_outliers + 1
print num_outliers, "values out of range"
<span style="color: darkred; background-color: lightyellow;">3 values out of range</span></pre>
<hr />
<p>Need to know it: in-place operators</p>
<pre># Count number of values out of range.

<p>Don't actually "need" to know it</p>
<p>But it's a common idiom in many languages</p>
<hr />
<p>Data cleanup</p>
<ul>
<li>Values are supposed to be monotonic increasing</li>
<li>Check that they are, report where it fails if they're not</li>
</ul>
<pre># Report where values are not monotonically inreasing
data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8]
for i in range(2, len(data)):

<hr />
<p>Group by threes</p>

result = []
for i in range(0, len(data), 3):

<p>13 values = 4 groups of 3 and 1 left over</p>
<p>First question must be, what's the right thing to do scientifically?</p>
<hr />
<p>Let's assume, "Add up as many as are there"</p>

<p>But this is clumsy</p>
<hr />
<p>How do we add up the first three, or as many as are there?</p>
<p>Don't want to have to keep modifying the list as we try out ideas</p>
<p>So use a list of lists.</p>
<pre># Add up the first three, or as many as are there.
test_cases = [[],                     # no data at all
              [10],                   # just one value
              [10, 20],               # two values
              [10, 20, 30],           # three
              [10, 20, 30, 40]]       # more than enough

for data in test_cases:

<p>Can now try all our tests by running one program</p>
<hr />
<p>Back to our original problem: sum of at most the first three</p>
<pre># Sum up at most the first three values.

<p>That looks right</p>
<ul>
<li>Though if there were 100 tests cases, we would want different output</li>
<li>Come back to this idea later</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Need one more tool: nested loops</p>
<pre># Loops can run inside loops.

<p>Easiest to understand with a picture</p>
<hr />
<p>Final step: instead of starting at zero every time, start at 0, 3, 6, 9, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Need more test cases</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't need to test everything (which is why we skip from 40 to 60 to 80)</p>
<ul>
<li>We'll come back to how we decide what is or isn't a useful test case</li>
</ul>
<pre># Sum up in groups of three.

<p>Understand this in pieces</p>
<p>Outer <code>for</code> loop is selecting a test case</p>
<ul>
<li>So think about its body in terms of one test case</li>
</ul>
<p>Inner loop is going in strides of three</p>
<ul>
<li>So think about its body for some arbitrary value of i</li>
</ul>
<p>limit is as far as we can go toward three values up from i</p>
<ul>
<li>So <code>range(i, limit)</code> guaranteed to be valid indices for list</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Human beings can only keep a few things in working memory at once</p>
<ul>
<li>"Seven plus or minus two"</li>
</ul>
<p>How we actually understand this program is:</p>
<pre>for data in test_cases:
    result = sum_by_threes(data)
    print data, "=&gt;", result

to sum_by_threes given a list data:
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(data), 3):
        limit = min(i+3, len(data))
        sum = sum_from(data, i, limit)
        result.append(sum)

to sum_from given a list data, and start and end indices:
    sum = 0
    for i in range(start, end):
        sum += data[i]</pre>
<p>The computer doesn't care one way or another</p>
<p>But what <em>we</em> need is a way to write our programs in pieces, then combine the pieces</p>
<p>That's the subject of the next chapter</p>
