<p>
  Approximately seven months after
  our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/04/novice-r-discussion-summary.html">initial
  meeting</a>, the SWC R community has developed the first set of R lessons for use
  both in workshops and for self-directed learning from the SWC
  website. These novice R lessons are a translation of the
  current novice Python lessons.
</p>

<p>
  Translating these lessons was a big effort. Many thanks are due to both
  the major contributions made by
  <a href="https://github.com/sarahsupp">Sarah
  Supp</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dbarneche">Diego Barneche</a>,
  and <a href="https://github.com/gavinsimpson">Gavin Simpson</a>, as well as
  the contributions made by <a href="https://github.com/cboettig">Carl
  Boettiger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jainsley">Josh
  Ainsley</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chendaniely">Daniel
  Chen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BernhardKonrad">Bernhard Konrad</a>, and

  if I missed your contribution/review).

<h3>On language-agnostic lesson sets</h3>

<p>
  The current set of novice R lessons fulfill the vision described in
  a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jkitzes/7478566">summary</a> of a meeting
  back in October 2012:
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      There is a general belief that SWC should be "language agnostic"
      and primarily teach the computing skills that transcend individual programming
      languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, the R-based workshops should reuse as much material as
      possible from the existing curriculum and contribute language-agnostic
      improvements and new lessons back to the "main" Python-based lesson
      set.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <a href="https://github.com/braithwaite">Dan Braithwaite</a> and I recently
  taught these lessons at
  a <a href="http://jdblischak.github.io/2014-09-18-chicago/">workshop for
  novice biologists</a>, and it went very well. Even though we weren't able to
  get through the entire lesson on command-line programs, it was very satisfying
  to see all the lightbulbs go off as they made the connection between the
  commands they were running in the shell the day before and the R code they
  wrote the second day (if you're interested, see
  this <a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/pipermail/discuss/2014-September/002149.html">thread</a>
  for more details on how the workshop went).
</p>

<p>
  While focusing on language-agnostic principles enables us to cover lots of big
  ideas that are the core of Software Carpentry's mission like modular
  programming and automation, this means sacrificing the discussion of many
  important R-specific features. This has disappointed some R instructors. The
  dissenting view can be summarized by some recent posts to
  the <a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/listinfo/r-discuss">r-discuss
  mailing list</a>:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel">Dirk Eddelbuettel</a> wrote
  (<a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/pipermail/r-discuss/2014-September/000152.html
  ">post</a>): <blockquote>Should we not play to R's strength, rather than to
  another languages's weaknesses?</blockquote>
  And <a href="https://github.com/gavinsimpson">Gavin Simpson</a> added
  (<a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/pipermail/r-discuss/2014-September/000159.html
  ">post</a>): <blockquote>We seem to be compromising R and an R-like approach
  just to maintain compatibility with the python lessons.</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
  Thus we have two opposing philosophies. One wants to focus solely on the
  principles that transcend programming languages; while the other wants to
  teach the best practices through a more idiomatic approach.
</p>

<h3>A call for proposals</h3>

<p>
  We set out about seven months ago to create a set of lessons that would be
  developed, maintained, and used by everyone in the Software Carpentry
  community who is teaching R. Having built these lessons, I now question
  whether that was the right goal.
</p>

<p>
  First, while it was an accomplishment to finally have novice R lessons on the
  SWC website, the work of translating the materials ended up being done by only
  a few people, and only a few instructors have actually taught these materials
  in their workshops. Second, there is now another option for running R-based
  workshops, <a href="http://datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a>. Thus, the
  common debate on how much we should focus on programming best practices versus
  data analysis skills has been somewhat solved: a Software Carpentry workshop
  should focus on programming best practices and a Data Carpentry workshop
  should focus on data anaylsis skills.
</p>

<p>
  Third, in the wider SWC community, we are currently in the process of
  overhauling just about everything. The plan is
  to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/09/splitting-the-repo.html">split up the
  bc repo</a>, which will result in a
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/a-new-template-for-workshop-websites.html">new template
  for workshop websites</a> and a
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/a-new-template-for-lessons.html">new
  template for lesson material</a>. One of the motivations for this effort is
  that instructors want the flexibility to add domain-specific data and
  introduce topics in an order that makes the most sense to them.
</p>

<p>
  So instead of upfront trying to democratically choose a compromised solution
  for R-based workshops, let's try a more distributed approach. Any SWC R
  instructor can propose a new set of lessons and recruit other interested
  instructors to help create them. Once the lessons are finished, they can be
  submitted for official approval to be taught in Software Carpentry and/or Data
  Carpentry workshops (this approval process is also under development). With
  this approach, each set of R lessons will be maintained in proportion to the
  number of instructors interested in teaching them.
</p>

<p>
  If you have an idea for a new set of R lessons, please send your proposal to
  the <a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/listinfo/r-discuss">r-discuss
  mailing list</a>. You should include a basic outline of your approach and what
  you intend to cover. For an example, please check
  out <a href="https://github.com/sritchie73">Scott Ritchie</a>'s
  blog <a href="http://resbaz.tumblr.com/post/98891976764/alpha-testing-the-r-bootcamp-materials">post</a>
  where he outlines his idea for a set of R lessons. In addition to describing
  your approach, it would be useful to include the answers to the following
  questions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>How much time will it take to teach the lessons?</li>
  <li>Are the lessons intended for Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, or
  both?</li>
  <li>How can other instructors help? Do you need others to help create and/or
  review the lessons?</li>
  <li>What learners are you targeting? Novice, intermediate, advanced? A
  specific discipline? </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Hopefully this approach will lead to multiple sets of R lessons available for
  use in our workshops. I look forward to seeing the new proposals!
</p>
