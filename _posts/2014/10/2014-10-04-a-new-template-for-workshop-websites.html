  The first step in reorganizing the <code>bc</code> repository is
  making it easier (<em>much</em> easier) for people to create
  websites for workshops.  The
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc">current instructions</a>
  are almost 3000 words long, and even experienced GitHub users find
  the process daunting, so we're going to simplify things as much as
  we can, even if that means not doing things the "right"
  way.

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a repository has a branch called <code>gh-pages</code> (which
      stands for "GitHub pages"), then GitHub uses the HTML
      and Markdown files in that branch to create a website for the
      repository. If the repository's URL
      is <code>http://github.com/darwin/finches</code>, the URL for
      the website is <code>http://darwin.github.io/finches</code>.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an HTML or Markdown file has a header consisting of three
    dashes, some data about the page, and three more dashes:
<pre>
---
key_1: value_1
key_2: value_2
---
page contents
</pre>
    <p>
      then GitHub doesn't just copy the file over verbatim. Instead,
      it runs the file through a translator
      called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_%28software%29">Jekyll</a>
      that processes instructions embedded in the file to generate the
      final HTML.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of these instructions is <code>{% raw %}{{variable}}{% endraw %}</code>. When
    Jekyll sees this, it replaces the curly braces and the variable's
    name with the value of <code>variable</code>. This is used to
    insert things like contact email addresses into the
    page. (Variables from the page's header actually have to be
    referred to as <code>{% raw %}{{page.variable}}{% endraw %}</code>, rather than simply
    as <code>{% raw %}{{variable}}{% endraw %}</code>, because Jekyll can also get
    variables in other ways that we're not using.)
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a page like <code>index.html</code> has a variable
      called <code>layout</code>, and that variable's value
      is <code>standard.html</code>, Jekyll looks for a file
      call <code>_layouts/standard.html</code> and uses it as a
      template for laying out the page. This is used to give the pages
      in a site a uniform appearance.
  </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Setup</strong></p>
<p>
  Here's what you'll do to create a website for a workshop when we're
  done:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Download the latest version of a shell script
      called <code>create_workshop.sh</code> from the Software
      Carpentry website and run it like this:
  </p>
<pre>
$ bash create_workshop.sh github_user_name workshop_id
</pre>
    <p>
      where <code>github_user_name</code> could
      be <code>swcarpentry</code>, your GitHub ID, or whatever,
      and <code>workshop_id</code> is something
      like <code>2015-01-02-esu</code>. This will create a Git
      repository beneath the current working directory and fill it
      with starter files.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go into the newly-created directory
    named <code>workshop_id</code>. This will be a GitHub repository
    on your machine with a single branch called <code>gh-pages</code>
    containing:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>README.md</code> : a brief description of Software Carpentry with a prominent link to the workshop's GitHub page.</li>
      <li><code>Makefile</code>: contains commands for checking and building the website (see "Managing the Site" below).</li>
      <li><code>index.html</code>: the workshop's home page.</li>
      <li><code>bin/check.py</code>: a program to check the workshop's layout and the contents of its home page.</li>
      <li><code>_layouts/workshop.html</code>: a page template for the site.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This repository will have a remote called <code>origin</code>
      pointing at a newly-created
      repository <code>github.com/github_user_name/workshop_id</code>. (We
      could get rid of <code>_layouts/workshop.html</code>, and put
      everything in <code>index.html</code>, but we want to make it
      easy for instructors to add more pages to their website.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Edit the header in <code>index.html</code> to specify the
      workshop's dates, instructors, EventBrite registration key,
      topics, etc. (See "Required Variables" below.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure that <code>index.html</code> contains links to the
    lessons being taught in the workshop (see "Linking to
    Lessons" below).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Delete the installation instructions for software packages that
    aren't being used in the workshop (see "Software Installation
    Instructions" below).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>git push origin gh-pages</code> to publish the workshop's
      home page
      at <code>http://github_user_name.github.io/workshop_id/</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This is all we need to do to set up a single-page site for a
  workshop, because:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    We can load CSS, Javascript, and images from the Software
    Carpentry website.
  </li>
  <li>
    We can embed setup instructions in <code>index.html</code>, so
    there's no need for <code>_include</code> files.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>index.html</code> can link to rendered online versions of
    the lessons and the Code of Conduct, so we don't need to include
    that in the workshop site every time (but see "Customizing
    Lessons" below).
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Required Variables</strong></p>
<p>
  <code>index.html</code>'s YAML header must define the following
  variables in order for the workshop website to show up properly on
  the main Software Carpentry site:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>layout</code> must be <code>workshop</code> (which tells
    Jekyll to use <code>_layouts/workshop.html</code> as a page
    template).
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>venue</code> is the name of the institution or group hosting
    the workshop, such as "Euphoric State University".
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>address</code> is the workshop's address, such as "Room
    101, Winston Smith Memorial Union, O'Brien Street."
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>country</code> must be a hyphenated country name like
    'United-States'. It is used to look up flags for display in the
    main web site.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>latlng</code> is the latitude and longitude of the workshop
    site (so we can put a pin on our map).
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>humandate</code> is the human-friendly dates for the
    workshop (e.g., Jul 3-4, 2015). Please use three- or four-letter
    month names and abbreviations (e.g., <code>Dec</code> instead
    of <code>December</code>) so that columns will lay out properly on
    the main website.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>startdate</code> is the workshop's starting date in
    YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g., 2015-07-03.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>enddate</code> is the workshop's ending date in the same
    format. If your workshop is only one day long,
    the <code>enddate</code> field should be omitted.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>instructor</code> is a comma-separated list of instructor
    names. This must be enclosed in square brackets, as
    in <code>["Alan Turing","Grace
    Hopper"]</code>. Please do not include affiliations, links,
    or anything else besides the instructors' names.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>helper</code> is a comma-separated list of helper names
    formatted the same way, such as <code>["John von
    Neumann"]</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>contact</code> is the contact email address to use for your
    workshop, such as <code>alan@turing.edu</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The header may optionally define:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>eventbrite</code>: a multi-digit Eventbrite registration
    key. If you are using Eventbrite, the admins will set this key for
    you. If you are using something else for registration, this field
    isn't needed.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Software Installation Instructions</strong></p>
<p>
  We have tried managing software installation instructions three
  different ways in the last year. Several instructors found file
  inclusion directives and conditional blocks confusing, so we will go
  back to the brute force solution: the
  default <code>index.html</code> page will include setup instructions
  for everything, and website authors will delete the bits they don't
  need.
</p>
<p><strong>Customizing Lessons</strong></p>
<p>
  The default <code>index.html</code> page contains links to our
  standard lessons, along with a paragraph outlining what's covered in
  each. As with software installation instructions, instructors can
  delete links and descriptions that aren't relevant to their
  workshop, then insert links and descriptions for custom lessons of
  their own.
</p>
<p><strong>Managing the Site</strong></p>
<p>
  To help people manage their workshop sites, <code>Makefile</code>
  will contain these targets:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>make</code>: without a target, this will print help.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make commands</code>: prints the same help.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make check</code>: run <code>bin/check.py</code> to make
    sure everything is formatted properly, and print error messages
    identifying problems if it's not.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make site</code>: build the workshop website locally for
    previewing. This assumes <code>make check</code> has given the
    site a clean bill of health, and requires Jekyll. (You can push
    changes to GitHub and view them there as well.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make listed</code>: check that the workshop is listed on the
    Software Carpentry site.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make standalone</code>: get local copies of the CSS,
    Javascript, images, etc. (See "Localizing" below.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make page page_name.html</code>: create a new HTML page
    called <code>page_name.html</code> (or whatever) with the right
    header, layout, etc. (See "Adding Content" below.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make permission user_name</code>: give the user whose GitHub
    user ID is <code>user_name</code> permission to push to the GitHub
    repository, modify its issues, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make clean</code>: tidy up (i.e., delete the locally-built
    website).
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Localizing</strong></p>
<p>
  The repository will also have a read-only Git remote
  called <code>source</code> pointing
  at <code>github.com/swcarpentry/workshop_source</code>. If people
  want local copies of the CSS, Javascript, and images needed to
  render their site (e.g., for offline work), then can pull
  from <code>source</code>. (<code>Makefile</code> will contain a
  target for this.)
</p>
<p><strong>Adding Content</strong></p>
<p>
  Instructors can add their own data files, code samples, and so on to
  the workshop's web site simply by adding those files to the Git repo
  and pushing to <code>origin</code>. They can also run <code>make
  page page_name.html</code> to create a new page
  called <code>page_name.html</code>, then add it and
  push. <code>bin/check.py</code> and <code>make check</code> will
  check the format of these pages as well as the format
  of <code>index.html</code>.
</p>
<p><strong>Customizing Lessons</strong></p>
<p>
  If instructors want to present a modified version of a lesson, or
  add an entirely new lesson, they will:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    clone the lesson's repository on GitHub in the usual way;
  </li>
  <li>
    modify their clone;
  </li>
  <li>
    push the changes to their repository on GitHub; and
  </li>
  <li>
    add a link to their workshop's site pointing at that lesson.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Instructors <em>can</em> add lesson material to the workshop
  repository, but we will encourage them to keep the lessons separate
  because:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    It will keep the workshop repository small.
  </li>
  <li>
    It will allow other people to use their lessons by reference
    (i.e., by linking to them) rather than by value (i.e., by copying
    the material).
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sending Fixes</strong></p>
<p>
  The one thing this scheme <em>doesn't</em> have is a link between
  the workshop's repository and the <code>workshop_source</code>
  repository that contains the master copy of the workshop site
  material. This is deliberate: as per the current instructions,
  instructors can't just clone a website template repository on GitHub
  because GitHub will only let a particular user have one clone of a
  particular repository.
</p>
<p>
  In order to send fixes to the master copy of the website template,
  people will therefore have to fork <code>workshop_source</code>,
  make the changes in their local copy of that, and then issue a pull
  request. This does mean copying changes manually from a workshop
  website to a local copy of <code>workshop_source</code>, but there
  doesn't seem to be any easy way around that. In practice, we expect
  changes to the template will be relatively infrequent, so most
  instructors won't ever encounter this.
</p>
<p>
  Instructors and others <em>will</em> be able to file issues in
  the <code>workshop_source</code> repository to suggest
  improvements. We will also use that repository's wiki to keep track
  of teaching tips (just as we're using the <code>bc</code>
  repository's wiki right now).
</p>
<p><strong>Checklists</strong></p>
<p>
  When <code>create_workshop.sh</code> creates the GitHub repository
  for the workshop, it will also create several issues in that
  repository's issue tracker to help the workshop's hosts and
  instructors keep track of the things they need to do, such as
  sending out welcome messages to learners, checking that learners
  will have access to WiFi, and so on. Whoever created the GitHub
  repository will need to run:
</p>
<pre>$ make permission user_name</pre>
<p>
  for each of the other instructors to give them permission to push
  changes and modify issues.
</p>
