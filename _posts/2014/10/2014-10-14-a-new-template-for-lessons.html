  We blogged two weeks ago about
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/a-new-template-for-workshop-websites.html">a new template for workshop websites</a>.
  It's now time to start thinking about what lessons will look like:
  as we said at <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/09/sept-2014-lab-meeting-report.html">the last lab meeting</a>,
  we're going to break the current lesson repository into smaller and more manageable pieces,
  but we need to decide what those pieces will look like first.
  The post below is our current thoughts;
  comments and/or follow-on posts about alternatives like those already written
  by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/of-templates-and-metadata.html">Gabriel Devenyi</a>
  and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/yet-another-template-for-lessons.html">Raniere Silva</a>
  would be very welcome.

<h2>Terms</h2>
<p>
  A <em>lesson</em> is a complete story about some subject, typically
  taught in 2-4 hours.
</p>
<p>
  A <em>topic</em> is a single scene in that story, typically 5-15
  minutes long.
</p>
<p>
  A <em>slug</em> is a short identifier for something, such
  as <code>filesys</code> (for "file system").
</p>
<h2>Design Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    We define everything in terms of Markdown. If lesson authors want to
    use something else for their lessons (e.g., IPython Notebooks), it's
    up to them to generate and commit Markdown formatted according to
    the rules below.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will use Pandoc for Markdown-to-HTML conversion, so we can
    use <code>{.attribute}</code> syntax for specifying anchors and
    classes rather than the clunky syntax our current notes use to be
    compatible with Jekyll.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will avoid putting HTML inside Markdown since it's ugly to read
    and write, and error-prone to process. As a consequence, we put
    things like the learning objectives and each challenge exercise in a
    block indented with <code>&gt;</code> to make scope easier for
    people and machines to see.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Layout</h2>
<p>
  Each lesson is stored in a directory that is laid out as described
  below. That directory is a self-contained Git repository (i.e.,
  there are no submodules or clever tricks with symbolic links).
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <code>index.md</code>: the home page for the lesson. (See "Home
    Page" below.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>dd-slug.md</code>: the topics in the lesson. <code>dd</code>
    is a sequence number such as <code>01</code>, <code>02</code>, etc.,
    and <code>slug</code> is an abbreviated single-word mnemonic for the
    topic. Thus, <code>03-filesys.md</code> is the third topic in this
    lesson, and is about the filesystem. (Note that we use hyphens
    rather than underscores in filenames.) See "Topics" below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>intro.md</code>: slides for a short presentation (3 minutes or
    less) explaining what the lesson is about and why people would want
    to learn it. See "Introductory Slides" below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>glossary.md</code>: definitions of key terms. This is what the
    lesson exports that other lessons can use (just as an API is the
    functions a library exports for other code to use). See "Glossary"
    below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>reference.md</code>: a reference guide to key terms and
    commands, syntax, etc., to be printed and given to learners. See
    "Reference Guide" below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>instructors.md</code>: the instructor's guide for the
    lesson. See "Instructor's Guide" below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>code/</code>: a sub-directory containing all code samples. See
    "Software and Data" below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>data/</code>: a sub-directory containing all data files for
    this lesson. See "Software and Data" below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>img/</code>: images (including plots) used in the lesson. See
    "Images" below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>web/</code>: web resources, such as CSS files, icons, and
    Javascript. See "Web Resources" below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>_layouts/</code>: page layout templates. See "Web Resources"
    below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>_includes/</code>: page inclusions. See "Web Resources" below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>bin/</code>: tools for managing lessons. See "Tools" below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Makefile</code> contains commands to build and manage the
    lesson. (See "Tools" below.)
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Home Page</h2>
<p>
  <code>index.md</code> must be structured as follows:
</p>
<pre>
---
layout: lesson
title: Lesson Title
keywords: ["some", "key terms", "in a list"]
---
Paragraph of introductory material.

> ## Prerequisites {.prereq}
>
> A short paragraph describing what learners need to know
> before tackling this lesson.

> ## Learning Objectives {.objectives}
>
> * Overall objective 1
> * Overall objective 2

## Topics

* [Topic Title 1](01-slug.html)
* [Topic Title 2](02-slug.html)

## Other Resources

* [Introduction](intro.html)
* [Glossary](glossary.html)
* [Reference Guide](reference.html)
* [Instructor's Guide](guide.html)
* [Setting Up](http://software-carpentry.org/setup/some-page.html)
</pre>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> software installation and configuration
  instructions <em>aren't</em> in the lesson. They may be shared with
  other lessons, so they will be stored centrally on the Software
  Carpentry web site and linked from the lessons that need them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> the description of prerequisites is prose for
  human consumption, not a machine-comprehensible list of
  dependencies. We may supplement the former with the latter once we
  have more experience with this lesson format and know what we
  actually want to do.
</p>
<h2>Topics</h2>
<p>
  Each topic must be structured as follows:
</p>
<pre>
---
layout: topic
title: Topic Title
---
> ## Learning Objectives {.objectives}
>
> * Learning objective 1
> * Learning objective 2

Paragraphs of text mixed with:

~~~ {.python}
some code:
    to be displayed
~~~
~~~ {.output}
output
from
program
~~~
~~~ {.error}
error reports from program (if any)
~~~

and possibly including:

> ## Callout Box {.callout}
>
> An aside of some kind.

> ## Key Points {.keypoints}
>
> * Key point 1
> * Key point 2

> ## Challenge Title {.challenge}
>
> Description of a single challenge.
> There may be several challenges.
</pre>
<ol>
  <li>
    There are no sub-headings inside a topic other than the ones shown,
    and only one block of challenges at the end. If a topic needs
    sub-headings, it probably wants to be broken into two or more files.
  </li>
  <li>
    Callout boxes are formatted as block quotes containing a level-2
    heading having the <code>callout</code> class and some text, code,
    etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each challenge is formatted in the same way, i.e., as a block quote
    with a level-2 heading having the <code>challenge</code> class.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Introductory Slides</h2>
<p>
  Every lesson must include a short slide deck suitable for a short
  presentation (3 minutes or less) that the instructor can use to
  explain to learners what the subject is, how knowing it will help
  learners, and what's going to be covered. Slides are written in
  Markdown, and compiled into HTML for use
  with <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">reveal.js</a>.
</p>
<pre>
---
layout: slides
---
body of slides
</pre>
<h2>Glossary</h2>
<p>
  Each term in the glossary is laid out as a separate block quote,
  with the term in a heading. Yes, this is odd, but as noted in the
  introduction, we want to avoid putting HTML in Markdown, and we
  can't add identifiers to paragraphs using <code>{#whatever}</code>
  notation: that only works on headers.
</p>
<pre>
---
layout: glossary
---
> ## First Term {#first-anchor}
> The definition.
> See also: [another word](#another-anchor)

> ## Another Term {#another-anchor}
> The definition.
> See also: [first term](#some-anchor)
</pre>
<h2>Reference Guide</h2>
<p>
  The layout of the reference guide is up to the lesson's author. The
  only thing required is the YAML header:
</p>
<pre>
---
layout: reference
---
</pre>
<h2>Instructor's Guide</h2>
<p>
  The instructor's guide is laid out as follows:
</p>
<pre>
---
layout: guide
---

introductory text

## General Points

1.  first point

1.  second point (separated by blank line,
    may span multiple lines,
    starts with `1.` to indicate numbered list.

## Large Sub-Topic

1.  first point on a sub-topic large enough to need a section

1.  second point
</pre>
<h2>Software and Data</h2>
<p>
  All of the software samples used in the lesson must go in a
  directory called <code>code/</code>. Every sample must be listed in
  the file <code>code/index.md</code>, which must be formatted as
  follows:
</p>
<pre>
---
layout: index
---
* `filename.ext`: one-line description
* `filename.ext`: one-line description
</pre>
<p>
  Stand-alone data files must go in a directory
  called <code>data/</code>. Groups of related data files must be put
  together in a sub-directory of <code>data/</code> with a meaningful
  (short) name. Every data file or data set must be listed in the
  file <code>code/index.md</code>, which must be formatted as follows:
</p>
<pre>
---
layout: index
---
* `filename.ext`: one-line description
* `sub-directory/`: one-line description
</pre>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> This mirrors the layout a scientist would use
  for actual work (see Noble's
  "<a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000424">A
  Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects</a>" or
  Gentzkow and Shapiro's
  "<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/jesse.shapiro/research/CodeAndData.pdf">Code
  and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitioner's
  Guide</a>"). However, it may cause novice learners
  problems. If <code>code/program.py</code> includes a hard-wired path
  to a data file, that path must be either <code>datafile.ext</code>
  or <code>data/datafile.ext</code>. The first will only work if the
  program is run with the lesson's root directory as the current
  working directory, while the second will only work if the program is
  run from within the <code>code/</code> directory. This is a learning
  opportunity for students working from the command line, but a
  confusing annoyance inside IDEs and the IPython Notebook (where the
  tool's current working directory is less obvious). And yes, the
  right answer is to pass filenames on the command line, but that
  requires learners to understand how to get command line arguments,
  which isn't something they'll be ready for in the first hour or two.
</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>
  Images used in the lessons must go in an <code>img/</code>
  directory. We strongly prefer SVG for line drawings, since they are
  smaller, scale better, and are easier to edit. Screenshots and other
  raster images must be PNG or JPEG format. The <code>img/</code>
  directory does <em>not</em> need to have an <code>index.md</code>
  file.
</p>
<h2>Web Resources</h2>
<p>
  Files used to generate the HTML version of a lesson are stored in
  the following directories:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>web/css</code>: CSS style files
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>web/js</code>: Javascript files
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>web/img</code>: images such as logos and buttons
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>_layouts</code>: page layout templates
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>_includes</code>: inclusions in web pages, such as the
    standard header and footer
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These files will usually not be edited by lesson authors.
</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>
  The <code>bin/</code> directory contains a program
  called <code>check.py</code> that checks that the contents of the
  lesson conform to the rules above.
</p>
<p>
  The lesson's root directory contains a <code>Makefile</code> with
  commands to manage lesson content. Its targets are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>make</code>: without a target, this will print help.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make commands</code>: prints the same help.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make topic dd-slug</code>: create a new topic file with the
    given sequence number and slug.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make check</code>: run <code>bin/check.py</code> to make sure
    that everything is formatted properly, and print error messages
    identifying problems if it's not.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make site</code>: build the lesson website locally for
    previewing. This assumes <code>make check</code> has given the site
    a clean bill of health, and requires Pandoc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make summary</code>: create a YAML-formatted summary of the
    lesson, including a list of the topics it includes, the terms it
    defines, the lesson's software requirements, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make clean</code>: tidy up (i.e., delete the locally-built
    website).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> The Makefile should also include targets to
  turn IPython Notebooks into Markdown and compare the result with the
  committed Markdown topic files, and do equivalent conversions for
  other formats.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> The Makefile <em>should</em> contain targets
  to re-run code and check the output, but there's no general way to
  do this (and we're not about to build our own literate programming
  environment).
</p>
