Among the many great lessons contained in Greg Wilson's recent post on 
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/09/building-better-teachers.html">building better teachers</a>, 
perhaps one of the most important was that in order to improve our collective teaching standards, we really need 
to <em>see</em> each other in action:

<blockquote>
<p>
The teachers described lessons they gave and things students said, but they did not <em>see</em> the practices. 
When it came to observing actual lessons&mdash;watching each other teach&mdash;they simply had no opportunity... They had, 
he realized, no <em>jugyokenkyu</em>.
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, I went ahead and recorded a 
<a href="http://resbaz.github.io/2014-09-15-unimelb/">Software Carpentry workshop that we hosted at 
the University of Melbourne</a> last month. I wanted to try a recording method that could be used by anyone, 
anywhere (i.e. no elaborate technological dependencies like lecture capture technology or a fancy external 
microphone), so I simply downloaded a 30-day free trial of 
<a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html">Camtasia</a> and set it to record a screencast, video and audio 
while I was teaching. The recording quality was even better than I expected, so feel free to check it out 
(and post feedback, which is the whole point of the exercise!) at the 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkBeePYo-_VCXtMNGDboOL66V-P2-jAoM">Research Bazaar YouTube 
channel</a>. In particular, there has been a lot of interest in my Git session, which took less than one hour.
