  As we mentioned <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/04/gsoc-projects-2014.html">back in April</a>,
  Gabriel Ivanica spent the summer working on a Google Summer of Code project called Browsercast.
  His goal was to build a web-native alternative to screencasts;
  if you'd like to see the result,
  head over to <a href="http://redenergy.github.io/Browsercast/">the demo page</a>,
  click on the eye icon in the upper left,
  and press the "play" button.
  I hope to use it,
  or something descended from it,
  to build searchable, accessible narrations of our lessons
  that will play well on everything from desktops through tablets to mobile phones.
  If you'd like to help,
  please <a href="https://github.com/ReDEnergy/Browsercast">fork the project on GitHub</a>
  and dive in.
