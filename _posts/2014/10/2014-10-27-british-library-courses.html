  I had a chance to catch up with <a href="
  https://twitter.com/j_w_baker">James Baker</a> at the British
  Library on Friday, and discovered that they're running an amazing
  series of short classes on digital skills for librarians.  With his
  permission, I've posted their outline below, along with a few
  excerpts from their FAQ.  Some of it is site-specific, but I think a
  lot would be relevant elsewhere.  (Programming in Libraries was
  developed alongside writing
  <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash">these</a>
  <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/research-data-with-unix">lessons</a>
  for the Programming Historian and tweaked for the library audience;
  interested readers should also check out the practical elements of
  Managing Personal Digital Research Information work
  through <a href="http://sharonhoward.org/zoterowiki/">this public
  wiki</a>.)  If you'd like more information, please mail

  The Digital Scholarship Training Programme is a Digital Research
  team initiative to provide staff with the
  opportunity and space to delve into the key concepts, methods and
  tools that define today's digital scholarship practice.

<dl>
  <dt>Programming in Libraries</dt>
  <dd>
    This course provides an
    introduction to querying, transforming and mining research data
    using the command line.
  </dd>
  <dt>Digital Storytelling</dt>
  <dd>
    This course explores ways in which a variety of digital
    technologies can be combined to tell stories about our collections
    that can uncover novel perspectives and engage new audiences.
  </dd>
  <dt>This is Digital Scholarship</dt>
  <dd>
    This course takes a thought-provoking look at how information
    technology has transformed research today, familiarizing you with
    the concepts, methods and tools that define digital scholarship.
  </dd>
  <dt>Metadata for Electronic Resources</dt>
  <dd>
    This course surveys current standards for describing and encoding
    digital artefacts. It covers digital formats for describing the
    contents and contexts of artefacts for use in libraries, archives,
    and online repositories including Dublin Core and OAI as well as
    their expression in different mark-up languages such as HTML, XML
    and RDF.
  </dd>
  <dt>Managing Personal Digital Research Information</dt>
  <dd>
    This course takes a look at that research management software
    and how it developed from supporting bibliographic uses to become
    repositories for research notes, digital objects, and
    collaborative projects that can be searched, tagged, interrogated,
    networked, and shared.
  </dd>
  <dt>Communicating our Collections Online</dt>
  <dd>
    This course explores opportunities for sharing our collection
    images online and on external platforms such as Europeana,
    Wikimedia Commons and Flickr in the context of the Library's
    Access and Reuse Policy.
  </dd>
  <dt>Digitisation at the British Library</dt>
  <dd>
    This course covers lifecycle digitisation project planning and the
    process for embarking on digitisation at the British Library
    including considerations of copyright, metadata, preservation and
    access issues.
  </dd>
  <dt>Geo-referencing and Digital Mapping</dt>
  <dd>
    Through guided tasks and short talks, this course explores how
    geo-referencing and geo-tagging can be used to display content in
    innovative, research orientated, and user-friendly ways. It 
    shows how digital mapping techniques produce maps that can be
    queried, layered, and presented in novel and unexpected ways.
  </dd>
  <dt>Information Integration: Mash-ups, API's and Linked Data</dt>
  <dd>
    This course introduces the fundamentals of information integration
    and sharing from web mash-ups and API's to semantic web/linked
    open data technology and how these technologies are being used to
    communicate and connect collections online.
  </dd>

    This workshop aims to help you uncover hidden datasets and to gain
    the skills to clean and arrange those datasets in ways which makes
    them more accessible for further analysis. The day primarily
    consists of a hands-on guided introduction to getting started with
    OpenRefine.

  <dt>Crowdsourcing in Libraries, Museums and Cultural Heritage Institutions</dt>
  <dd>
    Libraries, archives and museums have a long history of
    participation and engagement with members of the public. This
    course provides an understanding of what crowdsourcing is and

  FAQ:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>What is the Digital Scholarship Training Programme?</dt>
  <dd>
    A programme, launched Autumn 2012, of one-day courses for staff
    across the Library to have the opportunity and space to delve into
    the key concepts, methods and tools that define today's digital
    scholarship practice. Based on consultation with internal
    stakeholders as well as those in the HE, Cultural Heritage and IT
    sectors, the Digital Research Team have designed this unique
    programme to address the training needs of staff at the British
    Library. A team of first-class instructors from institutions such
    as the Open University, University of Sheffield, City University
    London, and the British Library has been assembled to deliver this
    learning programme.
  </dd>
  <dt>Who are the courses aimed for?</dt>
  <dd>
    Courses are designed to be introductory and are aimed at
    'Intelligent Novices', that is, colleagues who have heard about
    the concepts but haven't had the time, space or opportunity to
    really explore them in depth. It is very important to us that they
    be inclusive and accessible, challenging but not terrifying.
  </dd>
  <dt>What will my day look like?</dt>
  <dd>
    Most courses unless otherwise stated are designed to be a full-day
    experience and comprised of both a lecture and practical hands-on
    experience in order to provide staff with the best opportunity to
    fully engage with the topic. Colleagues will be provided with two
    short tea breaks and an hour break for lunch. Unfortunately
    catering cannot be provided.
  </dd>
  <dt>Will there be tests?</dt>
  <dd>
    No! But we do want to ensure that you get the most out of the day
    so there will typically be hands-on group activities that will
    give you the opportunity to apply your new knowledge. We will also
    ask for you to complete an anonymous self-assessment feedback form
    which will let us know how much you feel your knowledge of the
    topic has progressed from beginning to end of the course. This
    helps us to identify skills gaps that might need filling in the
    next semester's offering.
