  After
  the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/09/splitting-the-repo.html">splitting
  the repository post</a>, Gabriel Devenyi and Greg Wilson wrote some
  suggestions for how the new lessons repositories should look like
  (see <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/of-templates-and-metadata.html">Gabriel's
  post</a> about metadata
  and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/a-new-template-for-lessons.html">Greg's
  post</a> about overall file structure). From my experience at the
  Mozilla Science Lab sprint I don't like Gabriel's <code>preq</code>
  metadata because I don't believe it helps very much. I also don't
  like Greg's proposal to duplicate some files in every Git
  repository, so here are some changes that I suggest.
</p>

<h2>Design Choices</h2>
<p>In addition to Greg's design choices:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <em>Avoid the duplication of files across Git repositories</em>.  In
    Greg's proposal the Git repositories should store CSS and Javascript
    files needed to properly render the page. We could avoid it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Only automate the actions that users and developers will need to
      do very often.</em>
    We <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/pull/415">try to
      automate workshops' home page</a> but we are going to revert it. For
    that reason I think we should wait until people complain about the
    lack of some script before we write it.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Git Repositories</h2>
<p>
  The lesson repositories must have two branches: <code>master</code>
  and <code>gh-pages</code>. The <code>master</code> branch will store
  the lessons in Markdown (or any other format, that can be convert to
  HTML, wanted by the community). The <code>gh-pages</code> branch
  will store the HTML version of the lesson so that students can view
  it online.
</p>
<p>
  We had exactly this approach until a few weeks ago
  in <code>bc</code> repo. Why go back? In <code>bc</code>, we only
  merge <code>master</code> into <code>gh-pages</code> a few times and
  I would like to suggest that the topic manintainers do it before
  the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/09/sept-2014-lab-meeting-report.html">in-service
    days proposed at last month meeting</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Also, this approach will avoid the problem of have Markdown and HTML
  side-by-side since Markdown extensions support by Pandoc aren't
  supported by Jekyll.
</p>
<h2>Overall Layout for the Master Branch</h2>
<p>
  Changes to Greg's layout:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Drop <code>glossary.md</code> in favor of linking words to Wikipedia
    articles.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drop <code>web/</code> to avoid duplication of files across
    repositories.  Web resources, such as CSS files, icons, and
    Javascript, can be provided by a &quot;third-party&quot; server.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drop <code>_layouts/</code> and <code>_includes</code> to avoid
    duplication of files across repositories.
    <code>Makefile</code> will download the needed files from a
    &quot;third-party&quot; server when needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drop <code>bin/</code> to avoid duplication of files across
    repositories and scripts that no one will use.  In case we need some
    tool for managing lessons it should live in its own repository and
    we should ask contributors to install it.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Software and Data</h2>
<p>
  I suggest dropping <code>code/index.md</code>
  and <code>data/index.md</code> to avoid the work of keep them
  updated. Contributors can find the &quot;description&quot; of the
  files inside <code>code/</code> and <code>data/</code> using:
</p>
<pre>
$ grep 'filename.ext' *.md
</pre>
<h2>Overall Makefile</h2>
<p>Changes to Greg's proposal:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Drop <code>make topic dd-slug</code> because is easy to copy one of
    the previous topics and correct the filenames if needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make check</code> should run <code>swc-lesson-check</code>
    (that needs to be installed).
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make site</code> should download the necessary files
    (e.g. <code>_layouts</code> and <code>_includes</code>) and after
    that build the lesson website locally for previewing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drop <code>make summary</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>make release</code> should update <code>gh-pages</code> based
    on <code>master</code>. <strong>This should be only used by topic
      maintainers</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>
