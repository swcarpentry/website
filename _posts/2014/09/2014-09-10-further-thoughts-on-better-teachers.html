  On Greg's recommendation, I just finished
  reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-Better-Teacher-Teaching-Everyone/dp/0393081591/"><em>Building
  a Better Teacher</em></a> - it was an interesting book, and a well-written
  story. It turns out that I completely agree
  with <a href="building-better-teachers.html">Greg's assessment</a>
  of the book's lessons and the challenges facing Software Carpentry,
  but I very much disagree with his proposed solutions!

  On the idea of having a group call to discuss
  how recent bootcamps have gone every other week, I suspect that this is
  going to run into the fundamental problem that most of us not only teach
  bootcamps only once or twice a year, but we also only think about
  teaching bootcamps once or twice a year. I don't think many people (speaking
  for myself as well) are going to make the time to show up for one of
  these calls if we're not immediately about to teach a bootcamp, when
  we're in "teaching mode". On the taping idea, 5-10 minutes isn't
  nearly long enough to learn anything useful about the flow of a
  lesson - especially since, as the book points out, the important
  skill of teaching is usually how to respond to uncertainty and
  perceive misunderstandings from individual students' behaviors. I doubt that
  we'll be able to see that in such a short slice of time.
</p>
<p>
  More generally, in both cases, I think these miss the second biggest
  point of the book (after "good teachers can be made, but it requires
  coaching and practice"), which is that direct, "thick",
  interpersonal interactions are the way that coaching works. Big
  group events like this are too impersonal, in my opinion, to deal
  with the subtleties of learning to teach well.
</p>
<p>
  But I don't think all is lost. Here are two concrete
  counter-proposals that I think would work better (also inspired, of
  course, by the book). Both are essentially built around individual
  bootcamp experiences, when we have instructors' attention. Some of
  the other comments so far on Greg's blog post have hinted at similar
  ideas.
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Mentorship</strong>.
      This has been floated before in various forms, but I
      think that it's a great idea to have a handful of the
      instructors (senior instructors?) volunteer, or be nominated, or
      apply, to be a class of mentors. New instructors should be
      strongly encouraged (in a perfect world, required, but that's
      probably not feasible) to teach one of their first two
      bootcamps under the guidance of a mentor. The mentor will help
      with lesson planning, observe the lesson, help with real-time
      adjustments (i.e., whisper in the instructor's ear) if things
      are going off track, and provide feedback after the fact. This
      gives the new instructor the additional benefit of watching an
      experienced instructor frame an entire two day workshop. New
      instructors who really wanted to dive in deep could be encouraged
      to travel around to teach with a selection of several mentors.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sticking point would be how to select mentors and get them the
      additional training needed to be effective mentors. That would
      take some logistical work, but I think it's increasingly
      worthwhile to have this second "tier" of instructors as our
      group continues to grow. Think of those academic family trees -
      Greg is the "root PI", who trained a set of new PhD's at the
      beginning, some of whom (who wanted to put in the time and
      effort) started their own labs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Single bootcamp <em>jugyokenkyu</em></strong>.
      Sort of a light version of the above. At every bootcamp, the other
      instructors and helpers who are present should be tasked with observing
      (at least out of the corner of their eye) how an instructor teaches
      each lesson. Every instructor/helper should fill out a short, half
      page form at the end of a lesson telling the instructor four
      things - what went well from a teaching perspective and what
      could be improved, and what went well from a content perspective
      and what could be improved (always in a friendly way, of course).
      These are given to the instructors for review.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, at the conclusion of the bootcamp, the instructors sit
      together for 15-30 minutes to debrief on how the bootcamp went,
      discussing what's on the forms as well as bigger picture
      items. The lead instructor then reports back a summary of this
      discussion - a form could be useful, but I think two paragraphs
      of prose written to SWC central could be better. Note that this
      places a bit more burden on the lead instructor while removing
      it from the other instructors, as compared to each instructor
      filling out a survey.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  In both cases, what these really do is address what is at heart a
  question of scalability - how to create a less centralized and more
  networked architecture for SWC that is organized around smaller hubs
  and sub-groups of instructors, rather than have everything organized
  around a back and forth to and from the mothership, steered by Greg.
  Note that both of Greg's suggestions are based on a
  mothership-coordination model.
</p>
<p>
  Of course these are just suggestions, and details could surely be
  improved with further discussion. Speaking of which, perhaps we should
  organize a "task force" of us who are particularly interested in the
  pedegogical aspects of Software Carpentry to put a bit more effort
  into addressing these challenges?
