  After taking a break in July for our <a href="../07/sprint-summary.html">sprint</a>,
  and in August because people were on holiday, doing fieldwork, or both,
  we will resume our monthly online lab meetings this month.
  As always,
  we'll hold the meeting twice to accommodate time zones, childcare commitments, and the like;
  the first round will be 18:30-19:30 Eastern time on Thursday, Sept 25,
  and the second will be 11:00-12:00 Eastern time on Friday, Sept 26.
  We'll post connection details and the agenda closer to the time;
  if you have anything you'd like included,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">send us mail</a>.

    Update:
    we'll use <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-labmeeting-2014-09">this Etherpad</a>
    to manage the meeting,
    and will post connection details there on the day.
