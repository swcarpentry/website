  helps the next generation of open source contributors get started
  by teaching one-day workshops aimed at undergraduate and graduate students from all disciplines.
  This workshop introduces students to the tools and culture of open source development.
  We familiarize students with tools such as IRC, issue trackers and version control;
  talk plainly about aspects of open source that might be confusing or intimidating;
  introduce them to open source professionals who can talk about career and educational opportunities;
  and help them make their first contributions to open source projects.

  OSCTC will be hosting events this fall at over a dozen schools,
  including the City College of San Francisco,
  Bucknell University,
