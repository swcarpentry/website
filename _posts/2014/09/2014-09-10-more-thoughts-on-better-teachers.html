  Over the last few weeks I read Greg's blog post
  on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/09/building-better-teachers.html">Building
  Better Teachers</a> and watched
  his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e26rp6qPbA">Scipy
  keynote</a> and I've been thinking a lot about how can instructors
  share their knowledge.
</p>

<p>
  My story is the following. I graduated from Vassar College with a
  degree in Mathematics and New York Teaching Certification for
  Secondary Education (that's middle and high school) also in
  mathematics. Though this certification, I spent 2 semesters
  observing 2 different classrooms twice a week and 12 weeks student
  teaching. As a student teacher I worked with one teacher, shadowing
  them and eventually taking over the lesson planning and teaching of
  all 5 math classes. While we discussed teaching and lesson planning,
  I do not believe we engaged in the deep discussions of the Japanese
  instruction. We definitely were not talking until 8pm (I can't
  imagine how you could plan lessons for the next day, grade, and
  carry on that level of discussion). I left student teaching with the
  distinct impression that I was not ready to devote my life to
  teaching high school. I scrambled for a new life plan and found my
  self the following Fall pursuing a Master's degree in Astronomy.
</p>
<p>
  For my Master's degree I was introduced to very basic programming in
  Fortran 77 and taught myself IDL. It's time for a confession. The
  code I used for my thesis was not version controlled, there were no
  functions or classes; it was one long piece of code. Also, I have no
  idea what version I ultimately used to publish my thesis. It wasn't
  that I didn't want to program better or use version control, I had
  never heard of anything remotely like SVN or functions.
</p>
<p>
  Armed with a Master's degree in Astronomy I started working at the
  Space Telescope Science Institute. Here I learned Python (although
  not really functions) and finally, in September 2011, Greg came to
  teach Software Carpentry. If you look at my code, you can see the
  day I took SWC because I started writing functions. Greg taught us
  Subversion and I really liked the idea, but figuring out how to set
  up a server for myself was a barrier I never made it over (to be
  fair I never tried).
</p>
<p>
  Greg recruited <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#davis.m">Matt
  Davis</a> to teach SWC, Matt recruited me and I suddenly found
  myself signed up to teach SWC in Edinburgh in December. This before
  instructor training existed, Greg had never seen me teach, I had
  never observed SWC from a teaching perspective, and it was all new
  and terrifying. I quickly asked Erik Bray if I could tag along a
  bootcamp at George Mason University, just to give me some experience
  before being the US SWC representative to Edinburgh. It all went
  pretty well, I learned a lot, and met a great new group of people.
</p>
<p>
  From there I've had the pleasure to teach
  with <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#davis.m">Matt Davis</a>,
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#teal.t">Tracy
  Teal</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#viana.a">Alex
  Viana</a>, Chris
  Lonnen, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#slaybaugh.rachel">Rachel
  Slaybaugh</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#jackson.m">Mike
  Jackson</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#ely.j">Justin
  Ely</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#bray.e">Erik
  Bray</a>, and Greg. For me SWC represents everything that I love
  about teaching, inspiring students and sharing useful information
  that I wish I'd had, but without the things I hate (grading,
  students who do not want to be in class, writing tests, etc). It
  allows me to continue working on science and teaching (I'm still not
  ready to devote my life to teaching). I also learn something new at
  every SWC bootcamp I've taught. Seeing a different instructor teach
  material you've taught a different way is great. You pick up on
  things that they teach better and you can see what you like. I
  especially like the stories that Greg tells. They aren't quite the
  same when I tell them since it is second hand, but they are still
  great nuggets.
</p>
<p>
  So now that you have a history of how I came to be the person that
  I am today, here are my thoughts and challenges on communicating
  teaching skills, specifically in the context of SWC:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    First - in his keynote Greg asked why do teachers not share
    materials. I think some of it is that teaching is very
    personal. It is one thing to copy the teaching style of someone
    you are inspired by, who you have watched teach, and another to be
    handed something that someone says, "This worked for me." People
    teach with different styles. Everyone has developed their own
    way. How you distill down the "right way" or the "best way" is
    highly subjective. Many of our SWC discussions end with a bunch of
    ideas being thrown out and no final conclusion reached. I think
    this makes it difficult to collaborate on a single set of material
    without some oversight and ultimate decision making from
    someone. I've also found myself asking - is this change a personal
    preference or does it make the material better?
  </li>
  <li>
    This is a challenge for SWC. Our repository is filled with great
    ideas, but lacks the cohesion of a single path. This allows those
    familiar with the whole repository to design an individual
    curriculum for each bootcamp but it leaves those not familiar with
    the repository without a clear curriculum. When I taught
    intermediate Python, I dove into the material in the repo, but
    ended up rearranging a lot of it. We are in the process of
    synthesizing that material. But we've run into questions such as:
    should we be teaching numpy or pandas? The answer to this will
    vary person to person.
  </li>
  <li>
    Another confession: I don't know what is in the repo. Each
    bootcamp I look at another lesson, but I haven't had time to
    comprehensively look through everything. I took my instructor's
    training with the first class in the Fall of 2012, a lot has
    changed since then. I would like to see a streamlined repo. I
    believe that involves a new definition of our target audience
    (s?). What does a typical bootcamp look like. Is there such thing
    as a typical bootcamp? Is there a typical bootcamp for a
    particular field? For instance, when I teach astronomers I usually
    skip the shell section or give a very short advanced section, the
    Python is from the intermediate directory and the version control
    is from the beginner directory. I think it is rare for a bootcamp
    to be taught entirely from one level's directory and this format
    is confusing to students and to new instructors. If I wanted to
    look at the material most useful to my bootcamp, where would I
    find it?
  </li>
  <li>
    Even with a streamlined repository, I think we need a way to keep
    our instructors up to date on new developments, whether they are
    improvements to the lesson plans, new materials, or new
    techniques.
  </li>
  <li>
    I would use the bootcamps as a time to bring people together. You
    have at least 2 instructors who have likely never taught together
    planning material, executing it in front of each other, and
    leading a class through the material for 2 days. In every bootcamp
    I've taught I felt like I was pushing for this connections. Let's
    talk about what we are going to teach, how the bootcamp will go,
    do we want a capstone project, should we teach testing or code
    review. This is a time for people to connect with each other
    person to person and share their experiences. At the end of each
    day, the instructors should check in with each other. What went
    well, what didn't go well, what could we do better next time? Do
    we need to change the schedule for tomorrow, do we need to
    rearrange the classroom?
  </li>
  <li>
    I see helpers as instructors in training. It used to be that to be
    an instructor you had to either complete the online training or
    have been a helper 3 times. Even those who have taken the
    instructor training but who have never taught may want to be a
    helper at their first bootcamp. As an instructor I ask my helpers
    if they would like to take a 15 minute chunk of a lesson and teach
    the class. This gives them a taste of teaching but doesn't derail
    a section if it doesn't go well. I would like to see more of this.
  </li>
  <li>
    I would like to see a mentorship program. I know this is on the to
    do list and there are complications such as who should be a mentor
    and should every new instructor have a mentor, etc. A
    mentor/mentee relationship could provide one-on-one interaction
    between instructors. A mentor could comment on a lesson plan
    before instruction, answer questions the mentee may have, and
    provide a sounding board for new ideas or frustrations. I could
    see a mentor watching a lesson via Skype (or hangout) and
    providing feedback. I can also see a mentee reporting back on a
    bootcamp.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Finally, I want to share this with you. I heard a fascinating piece
  on the TED radio
  hour: <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/04/25/179010396/unstoppable-learning">Unstoppable
  Learning</a> by Sugata Mitra on children teaching themselves to use
  a computer with no instruction. In it he says: "If you allow the
  organizational process to self-organize then learning emerges. It is
  not about making learning happen, it is about letting it happen. The
  teacher sets the process in motion and then she stands back in awe
  and watches as learning happens."
</p>
<p>
  This is the role I see SWC taking in the lives of all of our
  students. We don't have time to teach everything, but we have time
  to set the process in motion.
