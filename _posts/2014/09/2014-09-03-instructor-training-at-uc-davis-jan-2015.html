  Thanks to support from Prof. Titus Brown,
  I will be running an intensive in-person version of our
  <a href="{{site.training_url}}">instructor training course</a>
  at <a href="http://ucdavis.edu">UC Davis</a>
  on January 6-7, 2015.
  This will be followed on January 8 by a third day of activities focusing on teaching computation and biology;
  for details,
  please see <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-davis-swc-training.html">Titus's post</a>
  and keep an eye on this blog for more information as well.
