  If you really want to dig deeper into educational research and how it applies to teaching programming,
  you should grab a copy of
  <a href="http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2012/isbn9789526046266/isbn9789526046266.pdf">Juha Sorva's PhD thesis</a>.
  The UUhistle system he built is interesting,
  and the research he did with it is thought-provoking,
  but what's <em>really</em> great is the summary of educational research in the first third of the thesis.
  I've <a href="{{site.training_url}}/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/sorva-thesis-1.pdf">extracted that part</a>
  with his permission,
  and I can't recommend it highly enough.
