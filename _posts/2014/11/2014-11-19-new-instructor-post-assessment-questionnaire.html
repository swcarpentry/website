  As <a href="revised-instructor-survey.html">mentioned two weeks ago</a>,
  a group led by Daniel Chen have been revising the post-workshop survey for instructors
  so that we can get a better idea of who's actually teaching what,
  how long it's taking,
  and how it's going.
  The latest draft can be viewed <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/nwV8yZl3sb">here</a>,
  and is included below.
  We'd be grateful for one last round of feedback&mdash;in particular,
  we're concerned about (a) the overall length
  and (b) how closely the headings are tied to our current curriculum.
  Please let us know what you think in comments on this post.
