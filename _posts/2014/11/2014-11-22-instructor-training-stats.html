  The Software Carpentry Foundation's board asked me for some stats on instructor training,
  and I thought other people would find them interesting as well:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      In the year Nov 1, 2013 - Nov 1, 2014, our numbers were:
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <tr><td>instructors:</td><td>360</td></tr>
      <tr><td>helper:</td><td>163</td></tr>
      <tr><td>learner:</td><td>3914</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      That gives us an 9:1 ratio of learners to instructors,
      but the reality is probably closer to 10:1,
      since we have all the instructors in our database
      but are still waiting for some recent workshops to report headcount.
      Note that "instructor" counts every time a person taught a workshop,
      including repeats,
      and similarly for "helper" and "learner".
      Note also that this significantly under-counts helpers,
      since they're often not reported or recorded.
    </p>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Since September 2013,
      but not including the recent live round at TGAC and University of Washington,
      or the current online round:
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <tr><td>started:</td><td>356</td><td></td></tr>
      <tr><td>completed:</td><td>98</td><td>(27.5%)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>incomplete:</td><td>163</td><td>(45.7%)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>in progress:</td><td>95</td><td>(26.7%)</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Note that half of those who drop out do so in the first four weeks.
      Note also that some people have been "in progress" for months,
      but even a few of those do eventually complete...
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      89 people who got their instructor badge after Sept 1, 2013 have taught for us,
      out of 126 who have been badged in that time.
      That's 70%,
      and the number will climb as the people who have been badged in the last three months
      (summer online training, TGAC, and U. Virginia)
      start teaching.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Of the people signed up for online instructor training in January 2015:
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <tr><td>66</td><td>US</td></tr>
      <tr><td>17</td><td>UK</td></tr>
      <tr><td>15</td><td>Canada</td></tr>
      <tr><td>12</td><td>Spain</td></tr>
      <tr><td>12</td><td>Australia</td></tr>
      <tr><td>5</td><td>unknown</td></tr>
      <tr><td>3</td><td>Brazil</td></tr>
      <tr><td>2</td><td>Netherlands, South Africa, Switzerland</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1</td><td>Chile, China, Colombia, Germany, Ghana, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japana, New Zealand, Poland, Saudia Arabia, Singapore, Turkey</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      and:
    </p>
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <tr><td>female</td><td>38</td><td>(25%)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>male</td><td>113</td><td>(75%)</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      That last statistic is better than the gender balance among our current instructors
      (20% female),
      but still much lower than where we were a year and a half ago (38% female).
    </p>

</ul>
