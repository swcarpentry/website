  As we <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/announcing-the-creation-of-the-software-carpentry-foundational.html">announced</a>
  two weeks ago,
  we are setting up an independent foundation to manage Software Carpentry's continued growth.
  This week, we passed an important milestone
  when we signed a fiscal sponsorship agreement with <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>.
  There are still lots of details to sort out,
  but here are brief answers to some of the questions we've received so far:
</p>
<!--more-->
<dl>
  <dt>Congratulations!</dt>
  <dd>
    That's not a question, but thank you :-)
  </dd>
  <dt>What is NumFOCUS?</dt>
  <dd>
    NumFOCUS is registered as a 501(c)3 charity in the United States
    which promotes and supports the ongoing research and development of open-source computing tools
    through educational, community, and public channels.
  </dd>
  <dt>What is the Software Carpentry Foundation's relationship with NumFOCUS?</dt>
  <dd>
    Partnering with NumFOCUS saves us the overhead of incorporating separately:
    they will accept donations and make payments on our behalf,
    handle reporting for tax purposes,
    and so on,
    so that we can concentrate on developing curriculum and delivering training.
  </dd>
  <dt>Is Software Carpentry still part of Mozilla?</dt>
  <dd>
    No.
    The <a href="http://mozillascience.org/">Mozilla Science Lab</a> is one of our partners,
    along with the <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/">Software Sustainability Institute</a>
    and <a href="http://lbl.gov">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>.
    All three are represented on our interim board,
    and we hope other organizations will partner with us soon as well&mdash;please
    stay tuned for announcements.
  </dd>
  <dt>Who works for the Software Carpentry Foundation?</dt>
  <dd>
    Greg Wilson has left Mozilla to work full-time for the SCF.
  </dd>
  <dt>Who is organizing workshops?</dt>
  <dd>
    Arliss Collins and Giacomo Peru are continuing to organize workshops as they always have
    as part of their jobs for the Mozilla Science Lab and the Software Sustainability Institute respectively.
  </dd>
  <dt>What about instructor training?</dt>
  <dd>
    Greg Wilson is continuing to do this, but has started training
    others to do it as well.
  </dd>
  <dt>Who's paying for all of this?</dt>
  <dd>
    We have several grant applications in the works,
    but are still trying to figure out how to supplement those
    with per-workshop donations, registration fees, and other income
    to become self-sustaining.
  </dd>
  <dt>Can my organization help, and if so, how?</dt>
  <dd>
    Yes: we are very interested in talking to potential partners who
    can help us organize and deliver training, and to sponsors who can
    help us financially.
    Please <a href="mailto:{{site.board_inquiries}}">contact the
    board</a> if you would like to help.
  </dd>
  <dt>How can I make a personal donation to the cause?</dt>
  <dd>
    You can send us money by PayPal,
    or <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact us</a> to arrange other payment methods:
    <div align="center">
    {% include paypal %}
    </div>
  </dd>
  <dt>How else can I help?</dt>
  <dd>
    The same ways you always have:
    host a workshop,
    become an instructor,
    contribute to our teaching materials,
    and help the scientists you work with adopt better computing practices.
  </dd>
  <dt>What happens next?</dt>
  <dd>
    The interim board will finish drafting the SCF's initial bylaws
    and arrange the transition to the first permanent board
    early in 2015.
  </dd>
  <dt>Where can I find out more?</dt>
