  In September, Greg Wilson wrote a
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/09/building-better-teachers.html">blog post</a>
  on "building better teachers" that was inspired in part by an 
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/689">issue</a>
  brought up by John Blischak on reporting time spent on lessons.
  In order for us capture this information,
  we decided to revamp our post-workshop instructor survey.
</p>

<h2>First Round of Data Collection</h2>
<p>
  We began by asking all the instructors who participated in teaching this past
  summer to report time spent teaching various subjects (Shell, Python, Git, etc) and
  anything that worked or did not work during the workshop.  A 
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/pull/789">pull request</a> provided
  the first pieces of data for instructors with regards to hours spent
  on each topic.
</p>
<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Git</th>
    <th>Python</th>
    <th>Shell</th>
    <th>SQL</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>N</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>min</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>1.5</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>median</td>
    <td>2.25</td>
    <td>4.5</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mean</td>
    <td>2.06</td>
    <td>4.9</td>
    <td>2.8</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>max</td>
    <td>3.5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>3.5</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  Other than Git, the times were fairly consistent with one another.
  I say "other than Git", because Damien Irving manages to teach it
  in one hour by having the participants type along command by command,
  but not have them complete any challenges.  (There is a
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/workshop-recording.html">recording</a>
  of him doing this for those who would like to see how this works.)
  Additionally, we only had one workshop that responded that covered all
  four topics; SQL is usually left out in place of more Python.
</p>
<h2>Revamped Survey</h2>
<p>
  The individual questions for the survey are at the end of this post.
  However, there are a few questions for the other instructors to keep
  in mind while reviewing the survey:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>What order should the questions be presented in?</strong>
    Should we ask all the questions pertaining to shell, then all the
    questions relating to Python, etc., (questions by
    lesson) <em>or</em> should we have a section for time, deviation
    from the repo material, etc and have all the topics under each
    section (lessons by question)?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Is there any other information you think would be useful
    to track?</strong>  I have added questions about the Software
    Carpentry Windows installer and Ipython Notebook
    use/installation/problems&mdash; what else should be there?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Would <em>you</em> take this survey?</strong>  Is it too
    long? Is the question format clumsy?  Any feedback on the survey
    design and layout is greatly appreciated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Are the reference examples for the Likert scale questions
    well spaced?</strong>  The reason for the reference example is to
    provide some context for instructors so we can have some
    standardized set of responses.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>How feasible is it to track individual topics in a
    lesson?</strong>  John mentioned that time spent on an entire
    lesson (i.e., total time for python) is not that useful when
    instructors are trying to pace the lesson.  For example, if there
    is only 30 minutes left for Python, is there enough time to teach
    the v5 testing material?
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>First Draft of Revamped Survey</h2>
<p>
  The live survey can be

  The static post of the survey is replicated below:

    <ul>
      <li>What fraction of the attendees were complete beginners (no coding/command line experience at all)</li>
