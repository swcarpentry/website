  It's long overdue,
  but we've finally started a page to showcase
  the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/join/projects/">projects that our instructors are involved in</a>.
  If you'd like to add one,
  please send us a pull request
  or <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">mail us</a> for instructions.

<p>
  (Turns out, we do pretty cool stuff...)
