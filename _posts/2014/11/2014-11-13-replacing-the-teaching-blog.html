  We've been using a WordPress blog to manage <a href="{{site.training_url}}">instructor training</a> for the past two and a half years,
  and while it's served us well,
  it's clear that we've outgrown it.
  It's also clear (to me at least) that we should get instructors started on GitHub earlier,
  so replacing WordPress with a GitHub-backed blog seems like it would serve a dual purpose.
</p>
<p>
  Our requirements are:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      We need to bring over all the existing content, including comments
      (which I'd like to push into <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The layout for the blog needs to accommodate hundreds of contributors,
      some of whom may have taken part in several different cohorts.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It also needs to handle dozens of topics,
      which may be nested in various ways.
      For example,
      we want the rounds of training for each cohort nested
      (i.e., "Round 6" includes "Round 6.1", "Round 6.2", etc.)
      but we also want a nested display by topic
      (i.e., "Concept Map" includes "Round 5.1", "Round 6.1", etc.).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  There's no science in it,
  but if you'd like to lend a hand,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">mail us</a> and let us know&mdash;it would be a great help.
