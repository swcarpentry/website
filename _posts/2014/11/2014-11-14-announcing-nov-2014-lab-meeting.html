  Our last online lab meeting for 2014 will be held at
  10:00 am Eastern time on Thursday, December 4,
  and will be repeated at 7:00 pm Eastern on the same day.
  (We had originally planned to have it on November 27,
  but that would conflict with American Thanksgiving.)
  If you're planning to attend,
  please add yourself to the Etherpad at
  <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-labmeeting-2014-11">https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-labmeeting-2014-11</a>
  so that we have an idea of numbers.
  We look forward to seeing you in a few weeks.
</p>
<p>
  And yes,
  we're calling it the November lab meeting even though it's in December,
  because it just wouldn't be programming without an off-by-one error...
