  I had never taught a Software Carpentry workshop before (though I
  have taught an <a href="http://python.g-node.org">Advanced
  Scientific Programming in Python</a> many times), so when the hosts
  for this one asked if I would be willing to do a full-week workshop,
  I said they were crazy ;) They convinced me to do it, but I said in
  that case I could only do that if I can recycle the materials I use
  for our summer school.  They agreed, and I managed to convince a
  buddy in Berlin to help me with tutoring.

  There were 28 students from Geophysics with a very diverse
  background in programming. Most did not know Python and several had
  only ever used Windows with GUIs. Given that, we soon figured out
  that the classic lecture-plus-exercises paradigm wasn't going to
  work, so we switched to a completely live-coding based approach. We
  would talk about tests while writing them for my own project, about
  Git while using it on a real paper, and so on. Based on the feedback
  we got at the end, it worked well.
</p>
<p>
  But in retrospect we won't do something like that again: performing
  non-stop from 9:00 in the morning to 6:30 in the afternoon, getting
  questions that made me question my own knowledge of Python (see
  below), improvising a live session on Python with MPI on clusters
  (of which I have zero experience) and resorted to teaching them how
  do you go about looking for libraries and docs in the SciPy
  ecosystem was exhausting. The feedback from the students was very
  positive, though, so it was a learning experience on both sides.

  Footnote: I was explaining the difference between passing by-value
  and by-reference and Python approach to this issue as compared to
  Matlab and to functional languages, But then someone came up with
  this example:
</p>
<pre>
>>> def mult1(x):
...     x = x*2
...     return x
... 
>>> def mult2(x):
...     x = [x*2]*2
...     return x
... 
>>> y = mult1([1, 2, 3])
>>> z = mult2([1, 2, 3])
>>> print y
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
>>> y[2] = 10
>>> print y
[1, 2, 10, 1, 2, 3]
>>> print z
[[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]]
>>> z[0][2] = 10
>>> print z
[[1, 2, 10, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 10, 1, 2, 3]]
</pre>
<p>
  I told to the students that in the case of <code>mult1</code> the
  return value bound to the name <code>y</code> has no "memory" of the
  fact that it has been created by concatenating two lists, so when
  you set <code>y[2]</code> the result is what you would expect. And
  then the student came up with the function <code>mult2</code> and
  told me that it seems like in this case the return value bound
  to <code>z</code> is actually "remembering" that it came from
  concatenating two lists, as seen when you try to
  set <code>z[0][2]</code> and then you get also <code>z[1][2]</code>
  changed.  A colleague told me he would interpret the results this
  way:
</p>
<pre>
z >>>>>>>> [ . , . ]
             v   v
             v   v
             v   v
             >>>>>>>>>>> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
</pre>
<p>
  <code>z</code> does not remember that it came from two lists. If it
  did, then setting <code>z[0][2]</code> would also
  change <code>z[0][5]</code>, but it doesn't.  But
  <code>z[0]</code> and <code>z[1]</code> point to the same object.
</p>
<p>
  I also don't think that mutability is important here. (It influences
  what operations can be performed, but not the identity of objects).
</p>
<pre>
>>> a = mult2((1,2,3))
>>> a
[(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)]
>>> a[0] is a[1]
True
</pre>
<p>
  If anyone has a better explanation, please do share.
