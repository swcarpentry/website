  Last week we ran an R-based SWC bootcamp at University of
  Sydney. The primary target audience encompassed grad students from
  the Department of Psychology who had little to no experience in
  programming. While some had previous limited experience with
  programming languages (e.g. MATLAB or R), most of them had been
  exposed only to statistical software such as SPSS.

<p>
  The audience was beginners, mostly from the Department of
  Psychology.  The instructors were Dan Warren (a post-doc in
  Biological Sciences at Macquarie University) and Diego Barneche (a
  PhD student at the same university), and our host was Prof. Alex
  Holcombe (Dept. of Psychology, University of
  Sydney).  <a href="http://dbarneche.github.io/2014-10-31-USyd/lessons/">The
  material we covered</a> included:
</p>
<p>
  <em>Day 1</em> Basics of R programming, including data types,
  subsetting and vectorized operations; functions in R; How to
  structure and organize projects; control flow (if/else, for and
  while loops, apply family in R, and the
  package <a href="http://plyr.had.co.nz/">plyr</a>).
</p>
<p>
  <em>Day 2</em> The Unix shell; version control in Git; exercises on
  GitHub; reproducibility, including an example with the
  package <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Most of the content was well managed within the
  original <a href="http://dbarneche.github.io/2014-10-31-USyd/">schedule</a>. We
  used <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> because it is a
  great user-friendly interface for beginners. Also, we provided them
  with
  a <a href="https://github.com/dbarneche/2014-10-31-USyd/tree/gh-pages/data/lessons.zip">.zip
  file</a> at the beginning of the bootcamp. This file contained a
  folder for each lesson, where an .RProj file with initial scripts
  and data was already provided. This approach confers nice advantages
  as each lesson already serves as an example of self-contained
  project, every student is standardized in terms of initial material
  and we avoid problem with full vs. relative paths.
</p>
<p>
  On the first day (Friday), we had 28 students. The room had two
  screen projectors available. One had RStudio opened 100% of the
  time, and the other contained Etherpad or some webpage used as an
  example to illustrate a case. On the second day (Saturday), we had
  only 15 students, but we had to move to a different room with one
  projector, so it was a bit annoying to switch between applications
  and/or tabs (e.g. from RStudio and Etherpad) and adjust screen
  resolutions when Dan and I had to swap our laptops.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Diego:</em>
  I suspect that the reason why we had a considerable drop-out from
  day 1 to 2 involved a combination of three things: (1) because it
  was Saturday; (2) because many students couldn't keep up with the
  pace on the first day; and (3) because they didn't have to pay for
  the course, so it wouldn't be a big deal to drop at a late
  notice. In my perception cause (2) was the major one, and I finally
  realized how hard it is to teach novices how to program. Maybe I
  spent too much time on the basics, including a bunch of examples on
  data structures in R. Although some people would rather drop some of
  the basics, I feel like without a basic foundation of data
  structures, R learners won't have the tools to teach themselves in
  the future and speed up their learning experience.
</p>
<p>
  I wonder if a three-day bootcamp is something to be reconsidered
  when it comes to novices. I do understand that people's (both
  instructors and students) availability is a major issue here, but I
  feel sometimes frustrated that we need to cover too much in a short
  amount of time. For instance, beginners have many questions
  regarding functions, and the topic itself is worth an entire
  afternoon (at least) of coverage. In such an ideal scenario, I would
  have chosen to cover basics and project set up during the morning of
  the first day, and then spent the entire afternoon teaching
  functions. Second day would be dedicated to control flow in the
  first half and shell in the second. And the final day dedicated to
  git, exercises on GitHub (including branching, push/pull, merging
  conflicts and pull requests) and reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
  In any case, the audience was great in general, and many students
  took great advantage of the course. The git lessons were really
  nice, and students seemed to have fun with push/pull exercises and
  merging conflicts using GitHub. After having participated in 4
  bootcamps this year where shell was not the primary language, I
  wonder how much we need it. I'm not entirely sure that students are
  immediately convinced it is a great tool to operate a computer
  (though I use shell on a regular basis for my own work). Maybe part
  of it relates to all the unpredicted bugs on Windows machines - this
  can always be super annoying, or even its relatively reduced
  functionality on Windows. Maybe part of it relates to the fact that
  we don't have much time to cover it, so things like for loops,
  functions (covered in R anyway) and pipelining, which are the
  coolest topics in shell in my opinion, have to be put aside.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Dan:</em> When teaching functions, I really tried to use a lot
  of simple in-class exercises, and I feel like that was helpful. I
  think in the future I'm going to work towards including even more
  exercises, as I feel like it gives both the students and the teacher
  a moment to calibrate their retention and understanding of the
  material.
</p>
<p>
  I feel like everyone followed along with the shell exercises, but
  after the session I was asked by more than one student why they
  should bother to learn this. I feel like we came up with a couple of
  decent answers for them, but it really made me think; R is by its
  nature going to be of interest to a lot of scientists who are
  specifically interested in analysis, but who are not interested in
  becoming super-elite programmers. I've never sat in on one of the
  Software Carpentry Python courses, but I wonder if it's generally
  easier for them to motivate students to get into the shell and
  version control. Whether that's true or not, it really did emphasise
  for me that motivation is one of the key starting points for
  learning, and that imparting motivation is essential to good
  teaching. Something to think about for next time!

  Please leave your comments below, we'd really appreciate some
  general feedback from everyone who has (and hasn't) been on a
  similar situation.
