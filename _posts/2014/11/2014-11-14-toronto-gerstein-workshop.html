  Last week we ran a Python-based SWC workshop at the University of
  Toronto's <a href="http://gerstein.library.utoronto.ca/">Gerstein
  Science Information Centre</a>.  The advertised audience was
  graduate students, post-docs and other researchers in science,
  engineering and medicine at the University of Toronto.
</p>
<p>
  The workshop had about 20 learners. Most were grad students or
  postdocs in life sciences. The pre-workshop assessment said that
  about three-quarters of learners had some programming experience
  with about half of those having some Python; maybe half of the total
  had some familiarity with the command line.  Almost none had
  experience with version control or SQL.  The instructors were
  Pauline Barmby, Greg Wilson, and Thomas Guignard; helpers were Sahar
  Rahmani, Luke Johnston, Daiva Nielsen, Tom Wright, and Fei Xu.  Our
  host was Erica Lenton.

  Nearly everyone had done the software installation prior to the
  workshop (!), and not too many problems were reported.  The laptops
  in use were roughly 50% Mac, 40% Windows, 10% Linux.  A handful of
  learners ran into the Mac Git problem, on which more below.
</p>
<p>
  The physical layout of the room was not quite ideal: the projector
  was pretty close to the screen and so the projected area on the
  screen was quite small.  This meant that we had to use quite large
  fonts so that people at the back of the room could see, and only a
  few lines at a time could be visible in a terminal window.  The
  screen was also not centred in the room, which meant that people in
  the front row sometimes couldn't see it around the instructor, and
  there was a pillar in the room which didn't help visibility either.
  The learners were pretty patient with this, but more than for most
  workshops they really needed to have material on their own machines
  to be able to follow along.  Another issue with the room was that
  the desks were fairly close together: for cases where a learner
  would have been best-served by working with a helper rather than
  following the lesson, it wasn't really practical for them to move
  elsewhere, and conversations with the helper couldn't be kept quiet
  enough to not disturb others. WiFi was OK but not great, moreso on
  the first day. D. Nielsen noted that, "it appears some learners
  didn't feel comfortable putting up a 'help' sticky note. Helpers
  need to scan the classroom and look at learner screens to spot those
  who may be struggling."
</p>
  <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/2014-10-30-utoronto/lessons/">The
  material we covered</a> included: shell (Barmby), Git (Wilson),
  Python (Barmby and Xu), and SQL (Guignard).</p>
<p>
  <em>Pauline:</em>Most of the material in the beginner shell lessons
  was covered the first morning.  I found the pace a bit rushed and I
  would have liked more time for the students to work on their own - I
  think the lessons contain too much material to really be covered in
  3 hours. Topics I skipped over or felt I didn't explain very well
  included "spaces in filenames" and "redirecting input".  I didn't
  feel that I made very good use of the sticky note system in the bash
  session, although I did try something else: I made the questions at
  the end of the lessons into multiple-choice questions where they
  weren't already, and asked the learners to vote on them with
  coloured cards (link).  I think this would have been useful except
  that the available projection screen real estate was so small that
  the questions were unreadable!
</p>
<p>
  At the morning break, we put a tar file containing the "Nelle"
  file/directory structure and a PDF file with the multiple-choice
  questions on Dropbox, and links to these in the Etherpad. Learners
  were able to grab these and found them helpful in following along
  for the remainder of the bash session.  There was a slight hiccup
  here where the Dropbox file took a while to sync, so not everyone
  had access to the tar file right away.  Feedback from the morning
  session included the request to have these files available earlier,
  and to have an outline of topics available before the session
  started, plus requests to go slower!
</p>
<p>
  The afternoon Git session went very smoothly. Greg took the learners through making
  a repository and adding a remote on GitHub, the change/add/commit/push cycle, forking an existing 
  repository and adding the upstream remote, submitting pull requests, and 
  managing conflicts. As mentioned above, a few students ran into the problem with Git not 
  working on their Macs, for which the most obvious (but not-so-practical) fix is to 
  download Xcode and recompile
  <a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/pipermail/discuss/2014-October/002315.html">here</a>
  is a link to the e-mail list thread on this topic.  Helpers noticed
  that a few learners were playing with the GitHub GUI, which confused
  them a bit and caused some issues when someone was trying to create
  a pull request.  Maybe mentioning the existence of the GUI but
  suggesting that learners not use it while learning the command-line
  tool would be a good thing to do in future. Several of us liked
  Greg's drawing of how pull requests work. Do we have an image of
  that online?
</p>
<p>
  <em>Luke:</em> I wonder just how useful learning about GitHub and
  collaborating via GitHub is, especially considering how much time it
  takes. I know in my own experience and my own department,
  collaboration on projects doesn't happen too often as everyone's
  research is so diverse. Using Github as a backup is a good idea
  though. Has teaching branching ever been done before?  That is
  something I see people within medical/health science use more often.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Pauline:</em> The second morning's Python session could have gone
  more smoothly. I used the IPython console in Spyder, rather than the
  IPython notebook for this, in part because I thought that the
  notebook would result in me moving too quickly and in part because
  I've been having problems with notebooks scrolling very slowly on my
  machine.  Learners in the back still had trouble reading the text
  (can't zoom in much because we would lose the view of the whole page
  that way).  At the break F. Xu suggested we might try screen sharing
  services like join.me, but in addition to the WiFi bandwidth Greg
  had other concerns, so we didn't do this.
</p>
<p>
  I suggested to students that they should clone the workshop repo in
  order to get the CSV and other files we'd be working with, and so
  that they could follow along in the notebooks; or they could also
  just download specific files from the repo (which, of course, you
  can't do directly from the GitHub website; we could have done it
  with <a href="http://rawgit.com">rawgit.com</a> if I had thought of
  that!).  Not everyone was able to clone the repo (bandwidth), and in
  retrospect it would have been better to put a handful of files in a
  separate repository or elsewhere, so that everyone could follow
  along. We did end up copying one small program directly to the
  etherpad so learners could play with it and modify it, but this is
  obviously not an ideal solution.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Luke:</em>As the Python lesson is one of the most useful for the
  participants to follow along I think pausing the lesson to go over
  the download process would have helped, as a helper I felt I was
  scrambling to reach everyone with problems at this point. With the
  git session we knew that some people were going to encounter
  problems.  As a general solution I think we should take 10 minutes
  at the start of each session to ensure everyone is up and
  running. Perhaps a simple script could be written to ensure
  datafiles are available.
</p>
<p>
  Because getting going in the morning consumed quite a bit of time,
  the actual lesson started late and felt quite rushed. F. Xu notes
  that the Python lesson seems pretty linear, so when learners get
  lost first they have to spend time on catching up, or they get lost
  even more.  He felt that frequent coding exercises like the Unix
  lecture weould have been helpful. Many people were also confused by
  the syntax, as we didn't deliberately explain it at the beginning; a
  syntax cheat sheet would have been helpful.  I think it would have
  been beneficial for learners to spend more time working on their
  own&mdash;especially given that we had quite a few helpers so they
  could have gotten one-to-one assistance.  I covered numpy,
  functions, and loops before the morning break, with loops,
  conditionals, and command-line scripts afterward, then Xu Fei took
  over with defensive programming.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Fei</em>: I spent less than 30 min on my part. I think the pace
  was okay, but I could have explained better if I had more experience
  with it. Partially because I wasn't familiar with the code examples
  given in the lessons (except the first one).  I'd totally go through
  the lessons first by myself before teaching.
</p>
<p>
  Learner feedback emphasized many of the same things as from the bash
  session: need to have files in advance, wanted more time to
  practice, lesson was too fast. Many learners recognized defensive
  programming as a concept that they had not encountered before but
  would find helpful.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Thomas:</em>The second afternoon's SQL session was my very first
  time teaching an entire session, and it felt great!  I was glad to
  have Tom Wright, who is a seasoned SQL teacher, in the room as a
  backup, to help students get along and to provide the all-too-needed
  visual confirmation that I wasn't saying too many wrong things (he
  did correct me when I wrongfully surmised that JOIN ON was still
  different than JOIN WHERE - apparently not anymore). Beginner's luck
  aside, I think this session went well. Feedback from students and
  Tom indicated that the pace was about right. I was concerned that
  the challenges I had prepared were going to be too simplistic and
  slow down the process too much but it turned out OK I think. From
  the survey, it transpired that the vast majority of students had no
  experience with SQL, so a slow pace was what they needed.  Helpers
  reported getting fewer requests for help during that session.
</p>
<p>
  I tried sticking to the lesson material as close as possible,
  knowing that I could not cover everything. I choose to focus on
  SELECTing content and not CREATE table nor INSERT data, based on
  what I had seen in previous workshops. Maybe that was a mistake,
  especially since Greg did use table modification statements in his
  concluding live coding session, and it would have helped if I had at
  least mentioned that those statements exist, as Tom later
  suggested. I also left out SELECT DISTINCT because I had kept it as
  a topic to be addressed together with GROUP BY clauses, which I had
  meant to address only if there was enough time. Again, this was
  unfortunate because Greg did use those statements. For the last 40
  minutes of the session, I asked the students if they preferred
  hearing about more statements (in case I would have talked about
  GROUP BY clauses) or doing one more, Hallowe'en-themed challenge. By
  way of stickies, they chose the extra challenge (which was a rather
  half-baked attempt to bring zombies in the existing sample data; I
  don't think I was very convincing, but they seemed to enjoy the
  challenge nevertheless). Tom suggested I let the students work on
  the assignment during the last break. We then decided with Greg to
  shorten that last break a bit so that we could finish earlier - a
  good idea on a festive day like this.
</p>
<p>
  On the technical side, we had to my knowledge very few
  SQLite-related issues. Students had little trouble getting SQLite to
  run, a bit more downloading the sample database and correctly
  loading it in their instance of SQLite. Some students still had
  trouble identifying that they had downloaded the sample database in
  a different directory than the one they were running SQLite in.
  Unfortunately, running sqlite3 survey.db if the survey.db file is
  not there does not return an error, it creates an empty database,
  which caused some confusion. In retrospect, Tom's approach of having
  the students download the sql file instead and then loading it in a
  new database is probably better.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Fei</em>: I think the students were well-prepared in terms of
  installation and downloading (thanks to the first page Thomas had
  prepared).  Students were motivated throughout the session from what
  I remembered, and some were even excited to create their own
  database during the break! I think it was very well explained and
  the number of exercises were just right.  I think many people wished
  to have the relational model diagram displayed somewhere so that
  they can constantly refer to it when querying. Personally I find it
  helpful to have it on a separate screen (or blackboard), or even
  saved as a file for them to download. Also, I am not sure why in the
  course example, the same field is named differently in different
  tables. I understand that in the real world data are messy, but for
  beginners, it adds an unnecessary cognitive load (maybe that's why
  they are asking for the diagram frequently).  For my own practice
  when creating databases, I keep the field name consistent across
  different tables.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Luke:</em> The SQL lesson was very well recieved, the pacing
  seemed about right to me with plenty of challenge breaks. I think
  the progressive nature of the challenges is one think that makes
  this lesson well received. Unfortunately creating tables and
  modifying data was not covered. I know this is deliberately left
  until the end of the lesson but when time doesn't allow proper
  coverage I think it needs to be mentioned, even just mentioning
  "Other SQL commands exist to create tables and insert and delete
  data." would give participants who need this functionality somewhere
  to start.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Pauline</em>: The big lesson I took from this (my first attempt at
  teaching bash and Python) is the need to be better-prepared on the
  learner side. Most of my prep time was focused on making sure I
  understood the content, pacing and structure, but if I had spent a
  few more minutes thinking about what the learners were going to do,
  I would have had files ready for them, saving everyone some
  frustration. Next time!
