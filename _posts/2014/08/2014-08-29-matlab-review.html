<p>
  When Software Carpentry started running bootcamps back in 2012, Python was used 
  exclusively for the programming lessons. While these lessons were as language agnostic 
  as possible (i.e. the materials focused on transferrable programming concepts as opposed 
  to specifics of the Python language), people soon expressed an interest in running 
  bootcamps using other languages. R very quickly established itself as a regular 
  alternative to Python, but it wasn't until early 2014 that the first ever Matlab 
  bootcamp was held (see <a href="http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5324">here</a> and 
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/01/feedback-manchester-matlab-bootcamp.html">here</a> 
  for blog posts about the event; the official event page is 
  <a href="http://apawlik.github.io/2014-01-14-manchester/">here</a>).

  Fortunately for the Software Carpentry community, the instructors from that event have 
  subsequently written up their teaching materials and made them freely available via a 
  CC-BY (Creative Commons - Attribution) license (there's been some issues with the FTP 
  site where those materials are located, so in the meantime you can find a copy 
  <a href="https://github.com/resbaz/lessons/tree/master/matlab/intermediate">here</a> at 
  the Research Bazaar GitHub repo). There's still some debate as to whether the ongoing 
  maintenance and development of these materials should be supported by Software Carpentry 
  or MathWorks (because unlike Python and R, Matlab is proprietary software), but in the 
  meantime demand has been so strong in Melbourne that we went ahead and organised a 
  bootcamp as soon as we could get our hands on the teaching materials.
</p>
<p>  
  Our <a href="http://resbaz.github.io/2014-08-18-unimelb/">August bootcamp at the 
  University of Melbourne</a> filled the 45 seat room and had a further 25 on the waiting 
  list. On the first day we taught the new Matlab lessons, while on the second we covered 
  the standard Software Carpentry lessons on the shell and version control. In other 
  words, Matlab was used to teach programming, while the shell and version control were 
  pitched as tools to manage your code and data effectively.
</p>
<p>
  What I've tried to do below is distill the main comments/feedback received from 
  instructors, helpers and participants. For more detailed commentary, see 
  <a href="https://github.com/resbaz/lessons/issues/4">the relevant GitHub issue</a>. At 
  times these comments may sound critical, but it should be kept in mind that these 
  Matlab lessons are brand new. Unlike the current Python lessons, they haven't had the 
  luxury of years of development using feedback from hundreds of bootcamps. At the end of 
  the day, the participants at our bootcamp got the undivided attention of eight Matlab 
  gurus for two whole days (thanks to all the helpers who came along). Such dedicated 
  programming assistance is unheard of in the academic world, and consequently this 
  unique learning experience was greatly appreciated by all who attended.

<p>
  Comments:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Matlab materials provide approximately two challenges for each of the four main 
    lessons (see <a href="https://github.com/resbaz/lessons/blob/master/matlab/intermediate/InstructorMaterials/AppendixA_Exercises.m">here</a>). 
    These challenges are very well documented (i.e. the relevant data files and answers 
    are all conveniently contained in an 
    <a href="https://github.com/resbaz/lessons/tree/master/matlab/intermediate/Exercises">Exercises</a> 
    directory), however their completion requires the participants to be familiar 
    with <i>all</i> the content in the associated lesson. Since each lesson 
    involves up to an hour of live coding/demonstration, the bootcamp involved very long 
    periods of demonstration followed by challenges that also took a very long time to 
    complete. This not only made it difficult for participants to maintain concentration, 
    but it also meant that there were long periods where the helpers weren't really 
    involved in the action.
    <ul>
	  <li>
	    There are shorter recommended activities scattered throughout the teaching notes, 
	    but these often ask the participants to do something they've never seen before 
	    (e.g. one of the recommended activities asks the participants to define a 
	    function, even though at that point the instructor hasn't even demonstrated the 
	    associated syntax and typical use cases). Our instructors therefore used those 
	    recommended activities as examples that they themselves could demonstrate to the 
	    audience.
	  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Unlike the novice Python lessons, there's isn't a consistent data analysis story 
    weaved throughout the four Matlab lessons. As a consequence, the data analysis 
    examples seem a little disjointed.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Matlab lessons and challenges escalate in complexity very quickly. In Software 
    Carpentry terminology, they are definitely "intermediate" as opposed to "novice" level 
    materials.
  </li>
  <li>
    One useful feature of the Python lesson materials is that the instructor notes are 
    essentially written as a verbatim script of what an instructor could/would say at 
    each point of the bootcamp. This makes things much easier for new instructors, because 
    there is no ambiguity about how the materials could/should be delivered. While the 
    Matlab materials provide significant guidance (i.e. they're not far off), they cannot 
    be used as a verbatim script.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Going forward, I think these Matlab materials should be designated as our current 
  intermediate level lessons, with a view to addressing the comments above in the coming 
  months/years (i.e. shorter and more regular challenges, a verbatim script to help new 
  instructors, a consistent data analysis example throughout, and a number of other small 
  fixes outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/resbaz/lessons/issues/4">GitHub issue</a>). 
  As a starting point for a set of novice level Matlab lessons, I would suggest we simply 
  re-write the current Python lessons using Matlab. Isabell Kiral-Kornek (one of the 
  instructors from our bootcamp) jumped in and made a start on this task right away (see
  <a href="https://github.com/resbaz/lessons/tree/master/matlab/novice">here</a>), and in
  the process of writing this post I was alerted to the fact that Ashwin Srinath has also
  made a start on precisely the same task (see his 
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/tree/master/novice/matlab">code</a> and 
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/686">discussion</a>). They've each taken
  a slightly different approach to the re-write (i.e. comparing and combining their materials
  will result in a better final product), however to avoid such duplication of effort in the 
  future we've setup a Matlab
  <a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/listinfo/matlab-discuss">mailing list</a>
  in order to keep the community updated with our progress.
</p>  
<p>
  Once Ashwin and Isabell (and anyone else who'd like to get involved) have completed the 
  re-write, the Software Carpentry Matlab materials will resemble the current state of the R materials: 
  the novice lessons will be a clone of the Python lessons, while the intermediate lessons are 
  an independent set. This development pattern seems reasonable in that similar lessons 
  are appropriate for novice learners no matter the language, whereas the teaching of more 
  complex topics quickly becomes more language specific.
