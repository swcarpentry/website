<p> At the beginning of this week Thomas Kluyver and I taught a Software
Carpentry bootcamp at the University of Cambridge. We had around 35 learners of
very different experience and took them through Bash, Git and Python over the
course of two days.</p>

<p> First of all I want to thank everyone who helped organize and run the
bootcamp this week, especially Thomas for sharing the teaching duties and our
excellent helpers Jelena Aleksic and David Molnar. We also had a lot of help
from our host Gabriella Rustici along with Paul Judge and David Judge. We held
the bootcamp in a university teaching room, so we used a suite of desktop
computers and had them all loaded with the Software Carpentry virtual machine,
which eliminated much of the extra time spent solving setup issues on the first
morning.</p>
<p> Since we also wanted people to go away with a working setup that they could
use on their own, I sent round the standard bootcamp installation instructions
to all the learners the week before the bootcamp and asked them to have a go
installing all the software on their own machines. The idea was that we could
then help people with individual installation issues during the coffee/lunch
breaks if necessary. In the end, only two people came to us having had problems
with installation, which probably reflects a mixture of improvements to the SWC
windows installer, a relatively high number of more experienced learners and a
number of people not attempting to install things before the bootcamp.</p>
<p>The pre-bootcamp questionnaire revealed a very wide spread of previous
experience. We had a number of absolute beginners, but nearly one third of the
group reported that they currently programmed once a week or more. Almost all of
the respondants also indicated that they had already had some experience with
the command line. In order not to frustrate those who had more advanced
knowledge, we decided to add links to some of the intermediate Software
Carpentry lessons on the <a href="http://rbeagrie.github.io/2014-08-26-cam/">bootcamp website</a>. At the
beginning of the first day we let everyone know that we were aware of the wide
range in experience but we would be working at a pace suitable for novices, so
anyone who felt comfortable with the material should feel free to work at their
own pace and move on to the intermediate material if they finished early.
Walking around during the challenges I had the impression that the vast majority
of the class was working at the instructor's pace, but perhaps knowing that they
weren't being forced to slow down helped the more advanced people not to get
annoyed. Even so, we had a few pink stickies at the end of the day from people
who felt that the Bash lessons were too slow for more experienced users, and
that the course website had not been clear enough about the expected entry
level.</p>
<p>Before the bootcamp I invested some time in organizing the files for the
shell lessons. Since we were working from virtual machines, it made sense to
have all the example files in a consistent file tree. I think this helped a lot
with the lesson flow, and we had a few learners comment that the unix session
was especially easy to follow. One person did say that we could have been
clearer about which directory everyone was supposed to be in at the beginning of
each new section. Thomas took the afternoon's Git session which seemed to go
really well. Instead of having the learners collaborate from two repositories on
their local machines, we had them pair up and work on each other's repositories.
This approach seemed to motivate people really well and we got a lot of positive
comments about that session at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Our biggest technical hurdle came on Wednesday morning, when it transpired
that I had forgotten to check that the iPython notebook was installed on the
virtual machines. After some copying and pasting of "sudo apt" commands, we got
the notebook working only to find that numpy and matplotlib were not installed
either. In the end it only took around 15 minutes to get everyone set up and
people seemed quite quick to forgive me my oversight! Our audience were keen to
learn about debugging and defensive programming, so Thomas and I decided to skip
SQL in order to give ourselves enough time to cover everything. Despite having a
whole day for python, we had still only gotten through the first three lessons
by the afternoon coffee break and decided to skip over if/else to get to the
material on assertions and test driven development. We got quite a few positive
comments about this material at the end, but there was also a little frustration
as some of the challenges in lesson five require if/else statements to solve.
</p>
<p>One final thing I'd recommend for anyone planning to run a bootcamp in the
future - I took a small notebook with me and wrote down lots of small issues
that cropped up as we were going through the material. If I hadn't written these
all down immediately I would have forgotten them by the end of the day, but I
now have a little stockpile of material for issues and pull requests I can send
back upstream, hopefully making things easier for myself (and everyone else)
next time around!</p>
