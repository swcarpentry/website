  Sumana Harihareswara, of the Wikimedia Foundation,
  has started compiling a list of
  <a href="http://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2014/08/10/1">inessential weirdness in open source</a>.
  (It was inspired by <a href="http://www.classmatters.org/2006_07/its-not-them.php">this article</a>,
  which made me blush:
  I was a howler more than once in my youth.)
  My question is,
  what inessential weirdnesses are we guilty of that aren't already in Sumana's list?
