  Over the past month and a half I have been fortunate to (co-)lead
  three bootcamps targeted at librarians, a relatively new audience
  for software carpentry.  These bootcamps have been located in
  Edmonton, Toronto, and New York, and in the same way that the term
  "librarian" is very broad encompassing many different disciplines
  and skill sets, the three bootcamps had their share of similarities
  and important differences.  I'll start with similarities and then
  discuss each bootcamp's differences.
</p>

<p><strong>Similarities</strong></p>
<p>
  The Edmonton and New York bootcamps were hosted by specific
  libraries, the Edmonton Public Library (EPL) and New York Public
  Library (NYPL) but open to librarians both within and outside those
  organizations.  The Toronto bootcamp was hosted by the Mozilla
  Corporation and advertised to librarians in the Greater Toronto
  Area.
</p>
<p>
  Two important similarities were 1) attendance was voluntary and 2)
  the bootcamps filled very quickly.  Edmonton was limited to 25
  attendees.  An email was sent in the early afternoon and all spots
  were filled by the next morning.  Toronto had 40 spots with about 30
  or so actually attending.  NYPL was open to 80 attendees, 40 within
  NYPL and 40 from the outer librarian community.  The 40 NYPL spots
  filled within 5 hours of the invitation email.  I'm unsure about the
  other 40, but I believe they filled just as quickly.
</p>
<p>
  The EPL bootcamp was the first of the three bootcamps, held in early
  July.  The bootcamp was advertised through out the Edmonton library
  community via email.  I was the only instructor for the bootcamp and
  so I tried to get as much input as I could from previous librarian
  bootcamps.  In particular, a librarian-oriented bootcamp was held at
  PyCon in Montreal in April, 2014.  Dhavide Aruliah wrote a
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/05/teaching-librarians-in-montreal.html">post-mortem</a>
  and I took all advice it suggested.  The primary suggestion was to
  be prepared to go slowly.  Dhavide wrote "We asked for feedback at
  the end of the first day.  There was an overwhelming consensus that
  we needed to slow down and to allocate more time for hands on
  stuff".  The instructors in Montreal thought on their feet and Jess
  Hamrick came up with a lesson based on processing a circulation card
  that formed the basis of their second day.
</p>
<p>
  Based on the above and some direct feedback from other coding
  librarians (Andromeda) we modified the bootcamp schedule to focus
  just on Python and library data and forego other SWC staples such as
  git and SQL.  Version control and databases are essentials for
  people who program, but for people who have not programmed their
  importance is not yet clear.
</p>
<p>
  In terms of material, we focused on creating three library-specific
  tasks.  The first was Jess's circulation card example, the second
  was processing of a spreadsheet of library hold data and the third
  was processing overdue fine payments.  The latter two of these
  lessons used real data given to us by the EPL.  These lessons were
  more than enough content for the two day bootcamps.
</p>
<p>
  In Edmonton, we started with shell and python basics.  We focused
  on answering the question, "How many holds are there for the title
  <em>Ender's Game</em>"?  We used shell programs to get the answer.
  This lesson introduced the concepts of files, working directories,
  the command-line and Unix pipeline model.  The hold data we had
  contained over 30000 hold records, so the need for automating it was
  clear to the attendees.
</p>
<p>
  I used this above lesson as the starting point in all three
  bootcamps.  We followed it with a slightly harder question "What is
  the most popular hold?" (spoiler: it was <em>Frozen</em>) and
  introducing the new tools necessary to answer it.
</p>
<p>
  After the shell, we moved onto Python.  We started from the very
  basics, literally "Hello World".  To help reinforce concepts of
  accessing and parsing data, we introduce Python by building
  solutions to the same questions above - holds on a particular title,
  then counting holds for all titles.  This lesson usually spilled
  over to the second day, but by the end of the first day, students
  had seen variables, math operators, opening and looping over lines
  of a file, and splitting column data in CSV files.
</p>
<p>
  The first day was very similar in all three bootcamps.  Our day 1
  feedback across all bootcamps was that is was generally well-paced.
  A handful said it was too fast, a few said too slow which with the
  group sizes we had is the best we can hope for.  From this point the
  topics in the bootcamps diverged on Day 2.
</p>
<p><strong>Edmonton Day 2</strong></p>
<p>
  The pre-bootcamp survey in Edmonton told us that 90% of the
  attendees had never programmed before.  For this reason we decided
  to stick with Python and work with librarian data on Day 2.  We used
  our second pre-prepared lesson of merging catalogue data.  The
  lesson was originally created and also taught by Vicky Varga of the
  EPL.  We concluded the second day by bringing together Python and the
  shell in running Python programs on the command-line.  We then left
  about an hour for attendees to play around and ask questions.
</p>
<p><strong>Toronto Day 2</strong></p>
<p>
  In Toronto, we had a larger portion of experienced attendees that
  wanted to move beyond Python (more than Edmonton for sure).  Sensing
  this, at the end of day 1 we took a vote as to what students wanted
  to do on the second day.  The choices were 1) more python with
  library data 2) git or 3) sql.  "More Python" and SQL won out.  So,
  the morning of the second day, we finished our Python program to count
  each title in the hold data.  This task requires dictionaries, so it
  took a good chunk of the morning.  We then finished the morning with
  about 1 hour of regular expressions.
</p>
<p>
  BUT, in the aforementioned vote on topics, we had a handful of
  students who in addition to voting for git wrote something to the
  tune of "Please, please teach git, this is why I came to this".  So
  we actually created a choice for the Day 2 afternoon.  The main
  group learned SQL using
  a <a href="http://acabunoc.github.io/swc-db/">library-based
  example</a> created by Thomas Guignard and Abby Cabunoc in the
  afternoon, but we had one instructor branch off (inside joke) to
  another room and teach git to the 6 or so students that really
  wanted to learn it.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, at the end of the second day, we left about 1/2 hour of
  free time for attendees to work.  This is where we learned that a
  few had hoped to learn about Python modules, something we didn't get
  to.  But, I showed a few of them an example of using the XLRD module
  to read Excel files directly.
</p>
<p><strong>New York Day 2</strong></p>
<p>
  At NYPL, we had 80 attendees so we split into two rooms due to
  capacity limits.  We had initially planned to have a "beginner" room
  and an "advanced" room, but in the pre-bootcamp survey, over 40 of
  52 replies indicated "I have not programmed before".  So, we decided
  to start both rooms with the basics we had used in Edmonton and
  Toronto.  Day 1 was similar in the two rooms working with the shell
  and an intro to Python from the very basics.
</p>
<p>
  On the second day, we decided to offer a choice since we had two
  rooms.  We decided to split on the two topics used on the second day in
  Toronto.  So, before lunch on day 2, attendees were asked to
  indicate which topic they wanted to attend in the afternoon - "More
  Python" or SQL.  We were considering offering a third option of git,
  but no one at the bootcamp had indicated a strong interest in git,
  we so decided not to.  Most students wanted SQL, but enough wanted
  more python to allow us to have one room of Python and one of SQL
  (If everyone wanted SQL we would have done it in both rooms).
</p>
<p>
  One point that I'll return to later is the importance of using
  library-specific examples.  For Day 2 at NYPL the "More Python"
  lesson was based on a problem one of our attendees discussed with
  us.  We hacked up a lesson in the late morning on Day 2 after she
  sent us some data files.  Moreover, we also got into processing MARC
  records from Python using a lesson that one of helpers Jared (a
  librarian coder himself) created on that day.
</p>
<p>
  A final point of clarification: while regular expressions and SQL
  were taught in both Toronto and NYPL, we did not get to using them
  from within Python (i.e., using the re and sqlite modules).  They
  were taught as separate concepts which I believe the audience still
  found value in.
</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p>
  It was great to teach librarians.  They were an excellent audience -
  interested, adventurous and at ease with each other because a good
  number knew each other already.  These qualities led to an
  interactive environment that is always more fun.  So what lessons
  did we learn?  Here are the suggestions I would recommend to anyone
  teaching software carpentry to librarians:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Librarians like Software Carpentry.  All three bootcamps filled
    quickly.  Many comments at the end mentioned an interest in a
    "Part 2" bootcamp to learn more.  Both EPL and NYPL (as well as
    librarians from other organizations who attended) have expressed
    interest in hosting another bootcamp in the future.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do a pre-bootcamp survey.  This is probably true with any
    bootcamp, but librarians carry a higher number of beginners and
    knowing how many is essential.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use Library-specific examples - audience-specific data is
    important.  "Data is just data" does not work.  Software Carpentry
    examples tend to be scientific in nature.  Using existing library
    examples mentioned above or creating examples from real data is
    important to capture the audience.  There is no single example
    that all librarians will find relevant, but as long as they can
    recognize the concepts, they'll be more interested to follow
    along.  One caveat: very narrow library-specific topics like
    processing MARC records was not of much interested in any
    bootcamp.
  </li>
  <li>
    Librarians liked to learn Regular Expressions and SQL. A good
    portion of librarians wanted to see them in Toronto and NYPL (and
    probably Edmonton too if I'd asked.)  Most librarians probably saw
    SQL and regular expressions during their degree, but level of
    coverage can vary greatly.  When preparing a bootcamp, I would
    suggest making time for these topics on the second day, even with
    a mostly beginner group.  And as mentioned, making the examples
    library specific helps and it's OK if you do not get to
    integrating regexes and SQL with Python, they're still valuable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Librarians are interactive.  Be ready to think on your feet.  In
    both Montreal and NYPL, lessons were created during the bootcamp
    to fit the audience.  So ask for examples from your audience and
    try to work them in where appropriate.  Also, be aware if your
    librarian audience gets too quiet.  It may mean you're losing them
    (true of any audience, really).
  </li>
  <li>
    We need more feedback on problems librarians would like to solve
    with programming - Following on the points above, Software
    Carpentry needs to build up a good set of of library-based
    examples.  Like anyone seeing a new tool for the first time, it's
    tough for librarians to know where software carpentry lessons
    might apply in their day-to-day tasks.  Ask for feedback during
    and after bootcamps and please share it.
  </li>
</ol>
