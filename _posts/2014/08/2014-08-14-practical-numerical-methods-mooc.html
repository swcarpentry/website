  As announced at SciPy'14 last month
  Prof. Lorena Barba will be teaching a MOOC titled
  <a href="http://lorenabarba.com/news/announcing-practical-numerical-methods-with-python-mooc/">Practical Numerical Methods with Python</a>
  this fall,
  and the <a href="http://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/courses/GW/MAE6286/2014_fall/about">course site</a> is now open for registration.
  Having worked through her excellent
  <a href="http://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/">12 Steps to Navier Stokes</a>
  notebooks,
  I think this will be a great course,
  and I urge everyone interested in the subject to check it out.
