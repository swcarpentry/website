<p>
  The <a href="http://bit.ly/uclrsdhire">University College London Research Software Development team is hiring</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
  Our goal is to enhance UCL's capacity to produce high quality
  research software, from simple but important data analysis scripts
  to complex simulations running on state-of-the-art supercomputers.
</p>
<p>
  The remit of the <a href="http://bit.ly/uclrsd">Research Software Development Team</a> is to:
</p>
<ul>  
  <li>
    provide researchers at UCL and their collaborators with the skills
    and tools they need to take control of their own software
    development, helping them create and maintain readable, reliable
    and efficient research Software
  </li>
  <li>
    improve the sustainability of software created at UCL in the face
    of changes to hardware, staff and funding over time
  </li>
  <li>
    encourage collaboration so that the life of software extends
    beyond the involvement of any one team or person.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We work as collaborators on research projects, providing a full
  software development service, and have contributed to projects from
  aneurysm blood flow simulation to ancient Iraqi text analysis, and
  from courtroom whodunnit bioinformatics to radiotelescope image
  cleanup.  We act as advisors to researchers on issues relating to
  their research software development activities or plans and provide
  infrastructure and tools useful for computational research.  We also
  provide training and teaching in programming and software
  development for research.
</p>
<p>
  If you join the team you will design, extend, refactor, and maintain
  Scientific software across all subject areas. You will provide
  expert software engineering consulting services to world-leading
  research teams, modify legacy software to run on state-of-the-art
  high performance computing infrastructure, and work with researchers
  to build software to meet new research challenges.
</p>
<p>
  The successful candidate will have created and maintained software
  to address advanced research problems in one or more fields, can
  rapidly assimilate understanding of new scientific questions, and
  quickly connect research needs to software requirements.
</p>
<p>
  If you are committed to software development best practices, and
  know how to adapt these to research contexts, are expert in one or
  more languages and platforms used for scientific computing, and are
  keen to expand your knowledge of many fields of research, please
  <a href="http://bit.ly/uclrsdhire">apply to join us</a>.
