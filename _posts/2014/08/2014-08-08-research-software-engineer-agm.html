  The Research Software Engineers community was founded to support the
  people who develop the software used in research. If you want be a
  part of the community, come to our AGM and hackday which takes place
  on 15-16 September at King's College London. It's a free event
  thanks to our sponsor Maudsley Digital.

<p>
  Back in March 2012, we began raising awareness of the research
  community's reliance on RSEs. In the last last year, we have made
  excellent progress in gaining recognition for the role. In the
  coming year, we want to continue this work, and attract more people
  to the community so that we have the weight of numbers to change how
  academia deals with its software developers.
</p>
<p>
  Register now!  There are only 80 places available at the AGM and 60
  at the hackday. If you want to attend, please register for free on
  <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/rse-agm-and-hackday-tickets-12457236931">our
  registration page</a>. You can elect to attend either the AGM, the
  hackday or both events.
</p>
<p>
  The AGM and Hackday will take place at Ortus, which is based at
  King's College London on 15 and 16 September 2014. More details are
  available on the registration page.  The AGM will feature various
  sessions designed to bring RSEs together, to swap expertise and to
  discuss how we can improve the situation of RSEs in academia The
  technology showcase provides you with time to discuss technology
  that you've developed, or just a technology that you like to
  use. Training sessions let you pass on expertise that you've
  developed to other RSEs. Finally, discussion groups let us pick your
  brains about issues that affect the RSE community so that we can
  better represent those views to research stakeholders
</p>
<p>
  In collaboration with our sponsor, Maudsley Digital, we will run a
  hackday on 16 September which will focus on how activity data can be
  used to help understand and diagnose mental health issues.  We will
  provide activity data and monitors, cloud resources, food, coffee
  and - of course - plenty of RSEs to hack with. We'll be asking
  clinicians to provide some pointers about the help that they need,
  but what you work on will be completely up to you. The best hacks
  will not only receive prizes, but will also get the chance to engage
  with Maudsley Digital to ensure that their work can be used to help
  the community.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, if the RSE Community is to last, it should be
  self-governing. For this reason, we will soon be holding elections
  for places on the committee that organises the community. The people
  who are interested in running the community will get the opportunity
  to present a lightning talk about why you should vote for them.
</p>
<p>
  Our thanks to Maudsley Digital who have provided us with an
  excellent venue and catering for the event. We would also like to
  thank Microsoft Research for providing tablets and passes for Azure
  Cloud. Other sponsors will be announced soon!
