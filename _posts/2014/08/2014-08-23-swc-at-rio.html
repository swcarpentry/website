  Last week, Raniere Silva and Alex Viana attended at
  <a href="http://www.cienciaaberta.net/encontro2014/">Brazilian Open Science Conference</a>
  where they ran a Git course for Software Carpentry and Alex gave a talk about
  Software Carpentry (like the
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/08/news-from-australia.html">one that Damien Irving gave at PyCon Australia</a>).
  Our workshop was a great time and from the feedbacks every student like
  it. One of the students said:
  <blockquote>
    Very didactic, the instructors showed much care, dedication and attention
    with the students.
  </blockquote>
  and another one
  <blockquote>
    Very good, from the basic to complex in a easy way.
  </blockquote>

  This course was different from most all of previous Git lesson taught by
  Software Carpentry instructors because (1) we used Git GUI instead of the
  command line and (2) we teach <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git
  merge</code> instead of <code>git pull</code>.
  Related with the use of Git GUI we choose it because we won't have time
  to teach the shell lessons and all students hadn't an programmer background. I
  was a little afraid that the GUI will be difficult for students to follow but
  this didn't happen. About teach <code>git fetch</code>
  and <code>git merge</code> we do that as one
  experiment to get data from one of our internal discussion and look like that
  students didn't problem with that.

<p>Most all the students complain about the short time for the lesson although
we had three hours of class. In my opinion this complaints was due, in part,
because of the fact that we start the lesson half one hour later since students
are later and we need to end it on the scheduled time.</p>
<p>Other complains raised by the students was: have more exercises and explore the
doors opened by this tool. I and Alex will try to address this in the others
workshops here in Brazil and will be happy to get suggestions on how to do
that.</p>
