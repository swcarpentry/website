  I'm very pleased to announce that our paper
  <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001745">Best Practices for Scientific Computing</a>
  has been published in <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/"><cite>PLOS Biology</cite></a>.
  It presents 24 specific things scientists can do to get more done in less time with less pain:
</p>
<!--more-->
<ol>
  <li>Write programs for people, not computers.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>A program should not require its readers to hold more than a handful of facts in memory at once.</li>
      <li>Make names consistent, distinctive, and meaningful.</li>
      <li>Make code style and formatting consistent.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Let the computer do the work.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Make the computer repeat tasks.</li>
      <li>Save recent commands in a file for re-use.</li>
      <li>Use a build tool to automate workflows.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Make incremental changes.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Work in small steps with frequent feedback and course correction.</li>
      <li>Use a version control system.</li>
      <li>Put everything that has been created manually in version control.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Don't repeat yourself (or others).
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Every piece of data must have a single authoritative representation in the system.</li>
      <li>Modularize code rather than copying and pasting.</li>
      <li>Re-use code instead of rewriting it.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Plan for mistakes.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Add assertions to programs to check their operation.</li>
      <li>Use an off-the-shelf unit testing library.</li>
      <li>Turn bugs into test cases.</li>
      <li>Use a symbolic debugger.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Optimize software only after it works correctly.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Use a profiler to identify bottlenecks.</li>
      <li>Write code in the highest-level language possible.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Document design and purpose, not mechanics.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Document interfaces and reasons, not implementations.</li>
      <li>Refactor code in preference to explaining how it works.</li>
      <li>Embed the documentation for a piece of software in that software.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Collaborate.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Use pre-merge code reviews.</li>
      <li>Use pair programming when bringing someone new up to speed and when tackling particularly tricky problems.</li>
      <li>Use an issue tracking tool.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
