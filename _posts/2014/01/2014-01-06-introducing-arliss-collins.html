  The incredible expansion of Software Carpentry over the last few months has
  been exciting and a little overwhelming, so we're pleased to introduce the
  newest member of the Mozilla Science Lab team, Arliss Collins. Arliss's
  background is in engineering and project management, and she'll be working
  with me, Kaitlin and Greg on bootcamp management, infrastructure development
  and maintenance, and communications.
