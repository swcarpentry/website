  This workshop builds on the success of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2013/07/wise-roundup.html">our first WiSE workshop</a>
  in Boston last June.
  It will cover topics such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Unix shell (and how to automate repetitive tasks);</li>
  <li>Git and GitHub (and how to use version control to track and share work);</li>
  <li>Python or R (and how to grow a program in a structured, testable, reusable way); and</li>
  <li>databases (and the difference between structured and unstructured data).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We are grateful to <a href="http://www.lbl.gov">LBL</a>
  and to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a>,
  <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>,
  and <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>
  for their generous support.

  <em>
    We realize this workshop conflicts with the first day of Passover. 
    Unfortunately the availability of the room 
    meant we didn't have much flexibility in terms of scheduling.
    We apologize, and hope that anyone who can't attend 
    this bootcamp because of the holiday 
    is able to come to another Software Carpentry workshop soon.
