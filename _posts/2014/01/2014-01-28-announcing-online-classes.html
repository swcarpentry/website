  We have tried several times to teach Software Carpentry online,
  but the results have always been disappointing.
  We are therefore going to try something different this spring.
  Instead of running a purely online course for several hours a week,
  we are going to run regular two-day workshops in four selected cities
  with a mix of in-person and remote instructors.
</p>

<p>
  These workshops will use the same format as our regular ones:
  up to 40 people in a room with their own computers
  for two full days of hands-on learning.
  The difference is that one of the instructors (and the helpers) will be on site,
  while another instructor will teach using a mix of webcasting and screencasting.
  We expect to hit a few potholes,
  but we also expect to learn a lot about what we can do
  to reach more people at <em>their</em> convenience.
</p>
<p>
  The sites for these workshops are still being finalized,
  so please keep an eye on this blog for registration information and other details.
  We hope to see you there.
