  We are pleased to announce that registration is now open for our largest event ever:
  on April 14-15, 2014,
  in association with <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/">PyCon 2014</a> in Montreal,
  we will run three Software Carpentry workshops in parallel,
  along with a master class in next-generation sequencing for bioinformaticians
  and an introduction to R for Python programmers. 
  (Note that these workshops are during the two days after
  PyCon, so you can attend both.)
</p>

<p>
  The regular workshops will be our largest ever, so we're splitting
  them into three rooms for learners at different levels.  We'll
  assign you to the most suitable level based on a survey we'll send
  out before the workshop, so you can be sure the material won't go
  over your head (or under your feet).  Material will include our
  usual topics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Unix shell (and how to automate repetitive tasks);</li>
  <li>Git and GitHub (and how to use version control to track and share work);</li>
  <li>Python or R (and how to grow a program in a structured, testable, reusable way); and</li>
  <li>databases (and the difference between structured and unstructured data).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Please <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pycon-montreal-software-carpentry-bootcamp-registration-10151376039">register here</a> for this workshop.
</p>
<p>
  We're also running two special one-day classes at the same time.
  The class on April 14 will be taught by Prof. Titus Brown, and will explore
  <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pycon-montreal-ngs-master-class-by-software-carpentry-registration-10151618765">next-generation
  sequencing</a> (NGS) and other topics in bioinformatics using
  Python.  The April 15 class, which will be taught by Prof. Ramnath
  Vaidyanathan, will be an
  <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pycon-montreal-r-for-pythonistas-master-class-by-software-carpentry-registration-10319320365">introduction
  to R</a> for Python programmers.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the tools and techniques you'll learn in these
  workshops, this is an opportunity to meet more than 150 other
  scientists who are using the same tools and facing the same
  challenges as you.  We encourage you to sign up in pairs or groups
  so that you have friends to work with at the workshop, and can
  support one another when you're back at your desk applying what
  you've learned.
</p>
<p>
  The workshops will take place at the
  spectacular <a href="http://congresmtl.com/en/montreal/near-the-palais/">Palais
  des Congr&egrave;s</a> in Montreal's International District, close
  to the Montreal business district, Chinatown, Old Montreal. The Palais is
  connected to the Montreal Metro's Place-d'Armes station.

    It's been brought to our attention that
    <a href="http://pycon.blogspot.ca/2014/01/pycon-us-20142015-and-passover.html">PyCon's workshops conflict with Passover celebrations</a>,
    and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
