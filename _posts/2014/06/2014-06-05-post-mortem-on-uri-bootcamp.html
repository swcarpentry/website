  In the later part of 2013, I started the process of co-hosting a
  Bootcamp with Peter August and Judith Swift both from the University
  of Rhode Island (URI).  During our discussions it became quite clear
  that as fantastic as the bootcamps are, it would be even better if
  we could extend the opportunities for learning.  We tossed around
  several ideas but eventually decided we would try a special topics
  course at URI.
  Thus, <a href="http://scicomp2014.edc.uri.edu/">Scientific Computing
  and Programming for Coastal Resource Managment</a> was born.  We
  opened the course up to any of the bootcamp participants who had an
  interest; official enrollment in the course was not required.  In
  the end we had about 10 participants who attendend regularly,
  including a few students who enrolled for credit. Pete August (URI),
  Adam Smith (URI), and myself co-taught the course.

  The content of the course was mostly determined by the students,
  with some classes led by myself, Adam, and Pete.  Since the content
  was largely up to the interests of the class, we did need a way to
  reinforce the lessons taught in the
  <a href="http://iglpdc.github.io/2014-01-13-uri/">bootcamp</a>.  To
  do this, we used blog posts, written in R Markdown, and turned in
  via Pull Requests as the mechanism for adding content to the course
  and reinforcing some of the version control lessons.  In the end,
  the
  course <a href="http://scicomp2014.edc.uri.edu/posts.html">covered
  material</a> from spatial data handling in R, to image processing in
  R, to pivot table like operations in R, to extracting zip codes from
  messy data.
</p>
<p>
  While this first run of the course was certainly experimental (and
  somewhat improvisational), the students indicated that it was
  helpful to have the extended exposure to R and computing.  Some of
  the specifics we learned:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Don't limit yourself to enrolled students: Many of the
    participants in the course were not officially enrolled.  In spite
    of this, they all were active members of the course, and
    contributed blog posts and presentations.  This had the added
    benefit of including students with a breadth of experience and
    backgrounds.
  </li>
  <li>
    Excercises are key: As this was our first go at this, we were
    feeling our way along and most of the posts and presentations did
    not have associated hands-on exercises.  All of the students we
    talked to indicated that having more hands-on exercises would
    benefit the course.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  So, given that the experience was a positive one we fully intend to
  offer this course again.  We plan to do it as part of a sequence
  with an initial bootcamp&mdash;perhaps
  a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/05/our-first-data-carpentry-workshop.html">Data
  Carpentry</a> bootcamp&mdash;followed by the course.  This
  additional opportunity helps keep the bootcamp experience and
  learning going and gives the students some directed guidance on how
  they can apply what they learned in the bootcamp to some of their
  own research questions.
