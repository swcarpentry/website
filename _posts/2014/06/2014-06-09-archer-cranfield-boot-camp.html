<a href="http://www.archer.ac.uk">ARCHER</a>, the UK's new national supercomputing service, offers training in software development and high-performance computing to scientists and researchers across the UK. As part of our training service we are running a 3 day Software Carpentry bootcamp and Introduction to Scientific Programming in Python at Cranfield University, UK, on 21-23 July.

<p>
Software Carpentry bootcamps help researchers become more productive by teaching software development skills that enable more to be done, in less time, and with less pain. We will cover skills including version control, task automation, good programming practice and automated testing. These are skills that, in an ideal world, researchers would master before tacking anything with "cloud" or "peta" or "HPC" in their name, skills that enable researchers to optimise their time and provide them with a secure basis to optimise and parallelise their code.
</p>
<p>
Our Introduction to Scientific Programming in Python, will provide an introduction to Python on ARCHER. We will introduce Python's capabilities for scientific computing, in particular the Cython, mpi4py, NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib Python libraries. We will also introduce how to interface Python with C and Fortran codes.
</p>
<p>
This course is being run by <a href="http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk">EPCC</a>, as part of ARCHER, and <a href="http://www.cranfield.ac.uk">Cranfield University</a>. The course is in collaboration with EPCC's <a href="http://www.prace-project.eu/PRACE-Advanced-Training-Centres">PRACE Advanced Training Centre</a> (PATC), and Software Carpentry, a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab">Mozilla Science Lab</a> initiative.
