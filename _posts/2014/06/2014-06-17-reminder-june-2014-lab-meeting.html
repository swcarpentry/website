  The next Software Carpentry lab meeting will take place next week
  at 10:00 am and 7:00 pm Eastern time on Thursday, June 26.
  (My apologies to people in Australia:
  I promised we'd hold the evening meeting first this time around,
  but unfortunately that slot conflicts with instructor training.)
  Our agenda is up on <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-labmeeting">this Etherpad</a>;
  we'll be discussing plans for the <a href="./update-on-sprint-plans.html">July sprint</a>
  and voting on several pull requests and proposals.
  If you'd like to cast a few votes,
  please take a few minutes before the meeting to look through the items that are on the agenda.
</p>
