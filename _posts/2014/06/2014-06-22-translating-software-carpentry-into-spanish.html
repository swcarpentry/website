<p>
  We are very pleased to announce that a group of volunteers have begun
  <a href="http://cacheme.org/software-carpentry-espanol/">translating our lessons into Spanish</a>.
  If you would like to help,
  please head over to <a href="https://github.com/franktoffel/swcarpentry-es/tree/master/translations/es">this GitHub repository</a>,
  which has instructions and contact information.
  Our thanks to Fran Navarro,
  David Perez-Suarez,
  Javier J. Guti&eacute;rrez,
  Iv&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez,
  Daniel Domene y Zuri Bauer,
  and Jorge Bernab&eacute; for organizing this,
  and to everyone else for lending a hand.
