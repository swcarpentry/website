  It takes a lot of work behind the scenes to match instructors to bootcamps,
  keep track of who taught (or learned) where,
  and manage our mailing lists.
  Our current cobbled-together tools are at their breaking point,
  so <a href="http://github.com/toolness/">Atul Varma</a>,
  a developer at Mozilla,
  put together a simple browser-on-the-desktop app
  to help administrators find instructors based on geography and skills.
  We'd like many other features&mdash;in particular,
  bulk upload of attendance lists from bootcamps&mdash;so if you would like to help us out,
  please <a href="{{site.github_url}}/admintool/">clone this repository</a>
  and send us fixes and additions.
</p>
<p>
  Many thanks to Atul for getting us started&mdash;we're looking forward to <em>not</em> grepping for instructors any more :-).
