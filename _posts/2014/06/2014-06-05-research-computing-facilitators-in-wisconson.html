  The <a href="http://aci.wisc.edu/">Advanced Computing Infrastructure</a> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
  seeks to hire two <a href="http://www.ohr.wisc.edu/WebListing/Unclassified/PVLSummary.aspx?pvl_num=79437">Research Computing Facilitators</a> (RCFs).
  The ideal RCF will apply a background of academic research and the use of computation to assist campus researchers
  in enhancing their research endeavors through the use of on- and off-campus compute resources.
  Additionally, RCFs should possess the interpersonal skills to interface with researchers (faculty, graduate students, etc.)
  and campus technical staff from a variety of organizations and compute-related services, including the campus's large-scale computing center.
  Primary activities include consultations with researchers and the production of education/outreach materials distributed on the web and in person.
  Experience teaching research computing topics, such as those in Software Carpentry bootcamps, will be a plus.
  Please see the full description for more details.
  All activities will be bolstered by participation in the <a href="http://www.aciref.org/">NSF ACI-REF program</a>,
  where a primary goal is to build an inter-campus network of facilitators and technical staff.
