<p><strong>Duties and Responsibilities</strong></p>

<p>A system manager is required to support teaching and learning in the
Department of Physics and Astronomy at UCL, and to provide some support
to administrative support staff.</p>

<p>Programming is an important skill for any scientist, as well as for many
graduates who go on to work in other fields, and the computing strand of
our degree programmes is continually being reviewed and updated. Other
courses, not focussed specifically on programming, are also increasingly
making use of e-learning technology and some computing to carry out
calculations and aid understanding of scientific concepts. These courses
all rely on expert technical support to ensure that the relevant
software is installed and configured correctly. We use Windows PCs
extensively in our teaching labs and administrative offices, and have a
Linux cluster for student use.</p>

<p>The postholder will provide support to staff and students, as well as
maintaining Windows and Linux systems, and assisting in the use and
development of teaching tools.</p>

<p>This post is open ended.</p>

<p><strong>Key Requirements</strong></p>

<p>The successful applicant will have a proven ability to communicate and
collaborate effectively with people of varying levels of technical
knowledge, a demonstrable interest in and knowledge of physics and
education, and excellent technical skills. A deep knowledge of either
Linux or Windows is required, along with some experience of the other
operating system and the willingness to learn more.</p>

<p>Applicants should have knowledge and experience of some of the relevant
technologies and tools. These include scientific software, programming,
e-learning systems, networking, and deployment and configuration of
computing hardware and services.</p>
