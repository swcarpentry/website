  The next of our monthly online lab meetings will take place on Thursday, June 26,
  at 10:00 am and 7:00 pm Eastern time.
  (As always, we'll hold it twice to accommodate people's work schedules and time zones.)
  We will update <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-labmeeting">this Etherpad</a>
  with agenda items as the date approaches.
