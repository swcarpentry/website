<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>
  We got word a few days ago that our proposal to the
  NSF's <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504976">Improving
  Undergraduate STEM Education</a> program had been rejected.
  The panel summary agreed that software training is a good idea,
  but were not convinced about our plans to shift from training grad students to undergrads. 
  In particular,
  they were not convinced that Unix-based workshops would be best for undergrads,
  and felt that not being embedded in the regular curriculum was a weakness.
  These are fair criticisms:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Most undergraduates only use GUIs and cannot navigate the terminal to save their lives.
    The perception that Software Carpentry is Unix-specific therefore hurt the proposal,
    and showed that we didn't clearly explain our focus on underlying concepts.
  </li>
  <li>
    The fact that we wouldn't be part of the regular curriculum is more difficult to address.
    The fact is,
    it really <em>is</em> hard to get undergrads to do things that interfere with earning grades,
    just as it's often hard to get grad students to do anything that doesn't immediately lead to a publication.
    Some of their concern about impact also seemed to be due to us concentrating on REU students,
    a self-selected bunch that already are motivated.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  At the same time,
  though,
  the panel did not connect the results from years of Software Carpentry workshops
  and the expected impact of this effort.
  This indicates that the proposal did not effectively communicate how well our experience to date
  has laid the groundwork for efforts like this.
</p>
<p>
  We're obviously disappointed by this rejection,
  but we've some useful lessons,
  and we hope that they will inspire others to put forward proposals of their own.

<h2>The Impact of Intensive Software Skills Training on Students' Scientific Careers</h2>
<h4>Rachel Slaybaugh, Kaitlin Thaney, Lorena Barba, C. Titus Brown, and Paul Wilson<br />with Ethan White, Tracy Teal, Greg Wilson, and Kathryn Huff</h4>
</div>
<h2>The Problem: Computational Competence in Science</h2>
<p>
  Scientists and engineers invented electronic computers to accelerate
  their work, but two generations later, many researchers in science,
  technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are still
  not <em>computationally competent</em>: they do repetitive tasks
  manually instead of automating them, develop software using a
  methodology best summarized as "copy, paste, tweak, and pray" and
  fail to track their work in any systematic, reproducible way.
</p>
<p>
  While the World-Wide Web was created by a scientist to help his
  peers share information, many still use it primarily as a way to
  find and download PDFs. Researchers may understand that open data
  can fuel new insights but often lack the skills needed to create and
  provide a reusable data set. Equally, any discussion of changing
  scientific publishing, making research reproducible, or using the
  web to support "science as a service" must eventually address the
  lack of pre-requisite skills in the general STEM research community.
</p>
<p>
  Studies have repeatedly shown that most researchers learn what they
  know about computing by word of mouth, but this approach is failing
  to meet present-day needs: most faculty would agree that today's
  graduates are no more able to use computing and the web <em>in their
  research</em> than they were a generation ago. Attempts to integrate
  more training in basic computing skills into undergraduate education
  have largely failed to take root for several reasons:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <em>The curriculum is full.</em> Undergraduate STEM programs
    already struggle to cover material regarded as core to their
    field. While many scientists would agree that more material on
    programming, reproducible research, or web-enabled science would
    be useful, there is no consensus on what to take out to make room.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>The blind leading the blind.</em> Many faculty lack
    computational skills themselves and hence are unable to pass them
    on.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Cultural difference.</em> Scientists and software developers
    have different priorities and different approaches to problem
    solving, which often impedes collaboration and knowledge transfer.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  One final issue is that <em>the rewards are unknown</em>. Open,
  web-based science is still in its infancy, so there is no general
  understanding of what people might need to know in order to
  incorporate it into their research careers. Since it is hard to
  measure something if you don't know what to look for, or if it is so
  young that there hasn't actually <em>been</em> long-term impact,
  little systematic study has been done to date of whether early
  training in the skills needed for this new kind of science actually
  has an impact, and if so, how and how much. Without such feedback,
  there is no systematic way to improve the training programs that
  currently exist.
</p>
<h2>Proposed Work: Leveraging Proven Curriculum to Promote Computational Competence in Science</h2>
<p>
  This proposal builds on the success to date of the Software
  Carpentry workshops, a proven curriculum of essential software
  skills that enhance the productivity of graduate students,
  post-docs, and faculty. We propose to:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    conduct formative evaluation of the impact of software skills
    training for undergraduates likely to continue in research careers
    as they progress through the early stages of those careers;
  </li>
  <li>
    conduct summative evaluation of the training's overall impact on a
    multi-year timescale in order to improve the content and
    presentation of the training; and
  </li>
  <li>
    disseminate the resulting curriculum widely.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  We will run software-skills workshops for undergraduate students
  taking part each year in summer research opportunities such as the
  NSF's Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, at or
  near the start of those students' time in the lab. Based on data
  already collected from Software Carpentry workshops, we expect this
  training will help them be more productive during their research
  (graduate-level participants in our existing workshops typically
  report that what we teach saves them a day per week) and will
  prepare them to work in a world where all aspects of science are
  increasingly dependent on computing.
</p>
<p>
  These undergraduates will serve as the treatment population for a
  five-year study of the impact of this training on their careers in
  general, and their involvement with open and web-enabled science in
  particular. In order to conduct this study, we will hire an expert
  in educational assessment, whose full-time work for the duration of
  the project will be to explore the effects of the training on
  workshop participants.
</p>
<h3>Workshops: A Distributed Model for National Impact</h3>
<p>
  We will run two-day workshops at a steadily increasing number of
  sites each year for five years, timed to coincide with the start of
  the summer influx of undergraduate research students. Each workshop
  will be offered to a minimum of 40 learners per site, giving us a
  target study population of at least 2200 students by year 5. The
  content will be tailored to meet local needs but will be based on
  what is being used at that time by Software Carpentry and affiliated
  educational efforts. By design, it is straightforward to adapt
  workshop materials and contribute changes to the Software Carpentry
  course material. These features enhance the portability and
  flexibility of the workshops and increase the likelihood of wide
  dissemination beyond this project.
</p>
<p>
  The home sites for investigators named in this proposal (George
  Washington University, Michigan State University, University of
  California, Berkeley, University of Wisconsin &ndash; Madison, and
  Utah State University) will run workshops in each of those
  years. Other sites will be added each year, expanding the total to
  15 in year 5 and accordingly increasing the size of our study
  population. We will focus expansion on NSF REU sites but, as
  detailed below, we will also offer some workshops to other
  communities.
</p>
<p>
  One set of possible sites for expansion are those campuses included
  in the "Condo of Condos" consortium, recently recommended for
  funding by the National Science Foundation. The Software Carpentry
  workshops proposed here will be valuable to that consortium in
  meeting its goals of increasing the number and diversity of
  researchers using advanced cyberinfrastructure and of developing
  data science practitioners.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond this consortium, we will recruit sites for hosting workshops
  by identifying locations at which we could have the largest impact
  and/or that contribute most to our goal of increasing diversity. If
  we find there are more sites interested in hosting workshops than we
  are able to support in a given year, we will select the subset of
  sites that best meet our goals.
</p>
<h3>Curriculum: From Tools to Techniques to Concepts</h3>
<p>
  While there is considerable scope for customizing workshops to
  accommodate learners' prior experience and discipline-specific
  needs, what these workshops seek to convey is the best practices a
  researcher needs to be <em>computationally competent</em>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    how to create, use, and share structured data
  </li>
  <li>
    how to automate repetitive tasks;
  </li>
  <li>
    how to track and share work over the web; and
  </li>
  <li>
    how to grow a program in a modular, testable, reusable way.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  With these objectives, the base workshop format will be divided in
  to four modules. All workshops will be hands-on so that learners can
  "learn by doing" and have experience with concrete examples. A
  typical workshop will devote roughly half of a day to each of the
  following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Working with Data: this module will introduce students to
    efficient data manipulation. Learners will work with data
    representative of their field of study. By the end of this module,
    learners will have the basic skills for parsing data, using and
    structuring databases, and conducting more sophisticated
    statistical analyses. We will point out why spreadsheets are
    insufficient for these types of tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Automation with the Unix Shell: this module will introduce
    learners to the shell; teach how to view, search, and manipulate
    text files at the command line; and introduce basic automation at
    the command line.
  </li>
  <li>
    Structured Programming: this module teaches learners introductory
    Python or R. Learners will be able to write short scripts and work
    in IPython Notebook, RStudio, or similar environments. This module
    will also teach key ideas&mdash;iteration, conditional statements,
    and modularity&mdash;that are essential for computational
    competence.
  </li>
  <li>
    Version Control and Data Sharing: this module teaches learners how
    to keep track of their code, data, and analyses in an open and
    reproducible way. The lessons will focus on data management
    strategies as well as provide an introduction to GitHub for
    version control of scripts, programs, analyses, etc. The real
    lessons here are about conducting open, reproducible research.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  As the module descriptions suggest, our real aim isn't to teach
  Python, Git, or any other specific tool: it's to
  teach <em>computational competence</em>. We can't do this in the
  abstract: people won't show up for a hand-waving talk, and even if
  they do, they won't understand. If we show them how to solve a
  specific problem with a specific tool, though, we can then lead into
  a larger discussion of how scientists ought to develop, use, and
  curate software.
</p>
<p>
  These workshops strive to show people how the pieces fit together:
  how to write a Python script that fits into a Unix pipeline, how to
  automate unit tests, etc. Doing this gives us a chance to reinforce
  ideas and also increases the odds of participants being able to
  apply what they've learned once the workshop is over.
</p>
<h3>Execution: Quality Instruction</h3>
<p>
  We will aim for no more than 40 people per room at a workshop, so
  that every learner can receive personal attention when needed. Where
  possible, we will run two or more rooms side by side and use a
  pre-assessment questionnaire as a sorting hat to group learners by
  prior experience, which simplifies teaching and improves their
  experience.
</p>
<p>
  All of the workshop instructors will have been trained and certified
  by Software Carpentry and will have had experience teaching this
  material prior to engaging in these particular workshops. Just as
  importantly, instructors will themselves be working scientists. By
  virtue of using these skills and concepts daily in their own
  research they are better able both to serve as role models and to
  deal with unanticipated questions or challenges based on personal
  experience.
</p>
<p>
  Software Carpentry has a rich network of trained instructors, often
  recruited from past workshops. These instructors are volunteers who
  participate for a variety of reasons including sharpening their own
  teaching and computing skills, increasing diversity in the pipeline,
  and because it's fun.
</p>
<p>
  As well as instructors, we will rely on local helpers to wander the
  room and answer questions during practicals. These helpers may be
  participants in previous workshops who are interested in becoming
  instructors, graduate students who've picked up some or all of this
  on their own, or members of the local open source community; where
  possible, we will aim to have at least one helper for every eight
  learners.
</p>
<h3>Increasing Diversity: Changing the Odds for Underrepresented Scientists</h3>
<p>
  In order to increase the diversity of the study population, at least
  one workshop in each year will be aimed specifically at female
  students. Software Carpentry's first such workshop, held in Boston
  in June 2013, attracted 120 participants; its second is scheduled
  for Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in April 2014, and at
  least two more will be held by the time work on this project
  commences (one in the United States and one in Europe). This work
  will build on that experience and draw on the pool of instructors
  who have gained mentoring experience through those specific
  workshops.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, we will organize workshops in years 2 through 5
  specifically aimed at students from minority serving
  institutions. We are already in contact with the Computing Alliance
  for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) and with the Association
  of Public and Land-grant Universities' program for historically
  black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Software Carpentry is
  running its first workshop at an HBCU (Spelman College) in early
  2014, and we expect to have significantly expanded these efforts by
  year two of this project.
</p>
<h3>Formative and Summative Assessment: Maximizing Learning and Impact</h3>
<p>
  We will employ an expert in educational assessment full-time for
  five years to monitor and compare undergraduate participants in
  these software carpentry skills building workshops, participants in
  a subset of our regular (graduate-level) workshops, and
  non-participants (as a control population). As part of their work,
  this person will be responsible not only for collecting and
  analyzing data but also for refining and extending the methods and
  measures used to gauge impact. D-Lab will assist in locating and
  supporting this expert.
</p>
<p>
  Assessment will build on previous work, focusing particularly, but
  not exclusively, on the following questions:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Are students who receive this training more likely than their
    peers to develop new tools and practices and/or become involved in
    outreach and education activities (i.e., are they more likely to
    become creators and leaders)?
  </li>
  <li>
    Are students who receive this training more likely than their
    peers to incorporate open science and/or web-enabled science tools
    and practices into their work?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do outcomes differ between women and underrepresented minorities
    on one hand and non-underrepresented minorities and men on the
    other? If so, in what ways, and what steps are effective in
    correcting for these differences?
  </li>
  <li>
    In what ways does this training change students' outlook on the
    practice of science itself?
  </li>
  <li>
    Are students who receive this training more likely than their
    peers to choose computationally oriented research topics and/or
    careers? Are those who do not choose computationally oriented
    paths nevertheless more likely to incorporate the tools and
    practices mentioned above into their work?
  </li>
  <li>
    Are students who receive this training more likely to continue to
    graduate school than their peers?
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This expert in educational assessment will explore ways in which our
  engagement with students changes the outlook and work practices of
  their peers and faculty supervisors (i.e., whether there is
  knowledge transfer sideways and upward) and the effectiveness of the
  community building and dissemination activities detailed in the next
  sections.
</p>
<p>
  As with Software Carpentry's work to date, assessment will use both
  qualitative and quantitative techniques. On the qualitative side, we
  will conduct a series of interviews over the five-year period of the
  study to see how attitudes, aspirations, and activities
  change. Quantitatively, we will measure uptake of key tools such as
  version control as a proxy for adoption of related practices, as
  well as exploring more traditional measures of research success,
  such as progression to graduate school and publication/citation
  rates.
</p>
<p>
  To track impact over time, we will conduct pre-workshop surveys and
  interviews roughly in the week before the workshops and the series
  of post-workshop surveys and interviews beginning approximately one
  month following the workshop. Follow on surveys and interviews will
  be conducted and the end of the students' lab appointment and
  annually thereafter (as applicable based on year of participation in
  the project).
</p>
<p>
  Our findings, and any new methods or measures developed, will be
  shared with other researchers through publication in peer-reviewed
  journals and high-profile conferences.
</p>
<h3>Community Building: Supporting Computational Competence</h3>
<p>
  We will employ one graduate student part-time at each site named in
  this proposal each year to provide technical support to workshop
  participants, and to act as an anchor for a Hacker Within-style
  grassroots group at that site. These community liaisons will not be
  study subjects but will help us stay in touch with students who are
  (a key requirement for any longitudinal study).
</p>
<p>
  Separately, the Mozilla Science Lab will focus part of its ongoing
  community engagement efforts on the students who have taken part in
  our workshops during both the remainder of their undergraduate
  careers and afterward to help them become part of the broader open
  science community. This may include helping the students organize
  and run workshops of their own in subsequent years, connecting them
  with other open science projects, introducing them to potential
  graduate supervisors who understand and value their new skills and
  outlook, etc.
</p>
<p>
  As a subordinate part of their work, the assessment researcher
  employed by this project will assess the effectiveness of the local
  graduate student organizers. In particular, they will explore
  whether seeding activity in this way leads to the formation of
  self-sustaining grassroots groups, and if so, what activities those
  groups develop on their own, how (and how effectively) they share
  discoveries with each other, the extent to which alumni of this
  program stay engaged with these groups, and whether the presence of
  these groups has a demonstrable impact on students' career paths in
  general and/or on their engagement with open and web-enabled science
  in particular.
</p>
<p>
  While it will not be feasible to bring all of the students
  participating in a given year's workshops together physically, we
  will organize and run virtual conferences toward the end of their
  research term to give them an opportunity to present their work to
  one another, discuss what they have learned and build peer-to-peer
  connections. These conferences will also provide an opportunity to
  introduce participants to new forms of scientific "publishing",
  including blogging, the creation of screencasts and demonstration
  videos, and other methods that may not yet exist.
</p>
<h3>Curriculum Development and Dissemination: Expanding the Impact</h3>
<p>
  We will employ one instructional designer part-time throughout the
  project to create new material and to improve existing material
  based on feedback from workshop participants and the assessment
  program. Here, "creating material" may include both designing and
  implementing new domain-specific learning modules and translating
  existing materials into new forms, such as video recordings of
  lectures or auto-graded quizzes for self-paced instruction. This
  work will be done in consultation with educators at participating
  institutions in order to encourage incorporation of those materials
  into existing curricula.
</p>
<p>
  All of the materials produced by and for this project will be made
  freely available under the Creative Commons &ndash; Attribution
  (CC-BY) license. The instructional designer will work with the
  Mozilla Science Lab and affiliated groups to share these materials
  and the results of our studies of the program's impact, through
  science education journals, conferences, and other channels.
</p>
<p>
  The dissemination of this project's curriculum has strong potential
  to be high. Current Software Carpentry materials are available as
  online lessons and in GitHub. Workshop materials will continue to be
  open access and flexible, thus they can be readily adopted by
  others. Adapting workshop materials is low cost and does not require
  special equipment. Workshop materials are structured such that they
  can scale to the size and application of interest to a particular
  group. Anyone using workshop materials can directly contribute
  changes and feedback, which both increases buy-in and improves the
  materials organically. The Software Carpentry infrastructure
  provides support in the form of materials and people. And finally,
  local chapters of The Hacker Within create a natural ecosystem of
  support for workshop participants, their peers, and faculty.
</p>
<p>
  As a subordinate part of their work, the assessment researcher
  employed by this project will assess the extent to which curriculum
  developed during this program is taken up by other educators
  (particularly those who think of themselves as scientists first and
  computationalists second), and their perception of its
  utility. Mid-point results of this evaluation will be shared with
  the instructional designer in order to allow evidence-based
  improvement of the materials.
</p>
<h3>Project Management</h3>
<p>
  Prof. Slaybaugh will be responsible for overall project management
  and reporting. The educational assessment expert hired by this
  project will report directly to her. Prof. Slaybaugh will be
  assisted by Dr. Huff, who will manage and coordinate the graduate
  student assistants at each site. Dr. Huff will also be responsible
  for organizing the workshops aimed at female students.
</p>
<p>
  Profs. Barba, Brown, White, and P. Wilson will be responsible for
  coordinating workshops and for recruiting and supervising the
  graduate student assistant at their respective
  institutions. Prof. Teal will co-coordinate the workshops held at
  Michigan State University and will assist in developing workshop
  materials.
</p>
<p>
  Dr. G. Wilson and the half-time instructional designer hired by this
  project will be responsible for preparation and publication of
  learning materials. Dr. G. Wilson will also provide instructional
  training for the graduate student assistants and other participants
  in the project on an ongoing basis and will be responsible for
  organizing the workshops aimed at students from minority serving
  institutions.
</p>
<p>
  Workshop operations (such as finding instructors and arranging their
  travel) will be handled by Mozilla staff who are performing these
  duties for the Software Carpentry program more generally. These
  staff will be supervised by Ms. Thaney, who will also be responsible
  for connecting the other PIs and the graduate student assistants
  with other open and web-enabled science groups.
</p>
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<h3>Theoretical Positioning</h3>
<p>
  Our theory of action is straightforward: if students are explicitly
  taught software skills in a way that makes them seem both useful and
  important, they are likely to begin using them in day-to-day work,
  which will create a positive feedback cycle leading them to acquire
  more (and more advanced) skills on their own. This positive feedback
  cycle will in turn result in the students being more likely to
  engage in open and web-enabled scientific activities that would
  otherwise have been unknown, incomprehensible, or out of reach.
</p>
<p>
  Using the terminology of, our work is primarily <em>design and
  development research</em>. We plan to design and develop solutions
  related to student engagement and mastery of specific skills,
  drawing on existing evidence from Software Carpentry's
  graduate-level workshops and investigating their impact and
  effectiveness. Further, we further plan to design and iteratively
  develop interventions. We are ready to begin collecting data on the
  feasibility of implementing solutions in typical delivery settings.
</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>
  Studies of how scientists use computers and the web have found that
  most scientists learn what they know about developing software and
  using computers and the web in their research haphazardly and
  through word of mouth. In our experience, most training meant to
  address this issue:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    does not target scientists' specific needs (e.g., is a general
    "Introduction to Computing" class shared with students majoring in
    other areas);
  </li>
  <li>
    only covers the mechanics of programming in a particular language
    rather than giving a complete picture, including data management,
    web-enabled publishing, the "defense in depth" approach to
    correctness discussed in, or the other foundational skills laid
    out in; and/or
  </li>
  <li>
    jumps to advanced topics such as parallel computing before
    scientists have mastered the foundations. Most research on
    scientific computing, such as, does the same.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  On the other hand, studies of how people in general learn to
  program, and of how effective different approaches to teaching them
  are, have made significant strides in the past decade. In
  particular, our work is informed by the long-running research
  program of Guzdial et al. at Georgia Tech, who have found that a
  "media first" introduction to computing outperforms more
  conventional alternatives and that it is possible to assess the
  extent to which programming concepts, rather than merely the syntax
  of a particular programming language, have been mastered.
</p>
<p>
  Others have demonstrated that peer instruction is a significantly
  better way to teach introductory programming than conventional
  classroom approaches. As discussed in the section below, we are
  already working to incorporate these evidence-based approaches into
  our teaching and will accelerate these efforts within the scope of
  this award.
</p>
<h3>Software Carpentry</h3>
<p>
  Software Carpentry is the largest effort to date to address issues
  surrounding inadequate software carpentry skill training for
  students. Originally created as a training program at Los Alamos
  National Laboratory in the late 1990s, it is now part of the Mozilla
  Science Lab's efforts to help scientists take advantage of ways in
  which the web can change the practice of science today and invent
  new ways tomorrow. Over 100 certified volunteer instructors
  delivered two-day intensive workshops like those described earlier
  to more than 4200 people in 2013 alone.
</p>
<p>
  Software Carpentry's curriculum and teaching practices have been
  refined via iterative design and are informed by current research on
  teaching and learning best practices.  Its instructor-training
  program, which takes 2&ndash;4 hours/week of a trainee's time for
  12&ndash;14 weeks (depending on scheduling interruptions),
  introduces participants to a variety of modern teaching techniques
  (e.g., peer instruction, active learning, and understanding by
  design), to concepts underlying these techniques (e.g., cognitive
  load theory), and to topic-specific work by computing education
  researchers (see,, and the first third of for overviews). One
  example of how they translate theory into practice is their
  insistence on live coding during teaching as a way of demonstrating
  and transferring authentic practice to learners.
</p>
<p>
  Evidence of instructor training and experience is based on a
  Mozilla's Open Badge program. Further levels of expertise are
  obtained through helping at a workshop, being an instructor, being a
  lead instructor, and developing workshop materials. All of the
  participants in this proposal are certified instructors and have
  taught or will teach Software Carpentry workshops prior to the start
  of this project. For example, Dr. Huff has already taught at 9
  workshops and Dr. G. Wilson has served as an instructor at 35.
</p>
<h4>Past Assessment</h4>
<p>
  Software Carpentry has been assessing learning outcomes and
  retention since the beginning of its Sloan Foundation funding in
  January 2012. The first round of assessment included both
  qualitative and quantitative assessment by Dr. Jorge Aranda (then at
  the University of Victoria) and Prof. Julie Libarkin (Michigan State
  University).
</p>
<p>
  Dr. Aranda surveyed and interviewed participants, observed a
  workshop, and analyzed screencasts of participants working through a
  programming assignment. The surveys and interviews were conducted
  both pre- and post-workshop. The survey asked questions regarding
  the software development habits of respondents, the tools they were
  familiar with, their level of knowledge of five core Software
  Carpentry topics (shell commands, Python, version control, SQL, and
  testing concepts), and their challenges in using scientific
  computing to answer their research questions.
</p>
<p>
  According to both qualitative and quantitative data, Dr. Aranda
  found significant increases in participants' understanding and use
  of shell commands, version control tools, Python, and testing
  techniques. Perhaps more importantly, participants reported better
  proficiency with software tools; greater concern for issues of
  provenance and code quality; better strategies to approach software
  development; and <em>new research questions</em> that have become
  accessible thanks to an increase in participants' software
  development skills.
</p>
<p>
  Students also took a quiz consisting of yes/no questions that were
  purposefully chosen so that only about half of them could be
  answered with the standard material in the workshop; the other half
  was not covered by workshop instruction. Additionally, a
  cross-cutting half could be answered with introductory familiarity
  to the topic in question, while the other half would represent more
  advanced levels of expertise.
</p>
<p>
  The objectives for this were to assess whether participants not only
  learned the workshop materials but were exploring the topics in
  greater depth on their own, and to avoid ceiling effects in our
  survey. Quiz performance improved across the board (by ~30%) for all
  question categories.

<p>
  Prof. Libarkin performed a more detailed assessment of participants
  in a workshop held at Michigan State University, which was attended
  remotely by students from the University of Texas at
  Austin. Prof. Libarkin also collected qualitative and quantitative
  data. Eighty-five percent of participants reported that they learned
  what they hoped to learn, 81% changed their computational
  understanding, and 96% said they would recommend the workshop to
  others.
</p>
<p>
  An attempt to scale this up in 2013 was set back by personnel
  changes, but systematic follow-ups with past participants in
  workshops have now been resumed, and we expect to be able to present
  preliminary results by mid-2014.
</p>
<p>
  Some excerpted survey questions from the discussed studies can be
  found in the full proposal, as can excerpted interview questions
  from Dr. Aranda's study. The studies mentioned here and the
  additional data that will become available within the next six
  months will serve as a starting point for this project's assessment
  expert.

<h3>The Hacker Within</h3>
<p>
  The Hacker Within (THW) was founded by graduate students, including
  Dr. Huff and Prof. Slaybaugh, in nuclear engineering at the
  University of Wisconsin &ndash; Madison to provide a forum for
  sharing scientific computing skills and best practices with their
  peers. As THW matured as a student organization, it attracted
  students from many scientific disciplines and academic levels. THW
  conducted bi-weekly seminars and developed a series of short courses
  addressing the programming languages C++, Python, and Fortran; best
  practices such as version control and test-driven code development;
  and basic skills such as UNIX mobility. This curriculum was
  delivered primarily as interactive short workshops on campuses and
  during scientific conferences. Many previous founders of the Hacker
  Within have since become instructors with Software Carpentry, and a
  new generation of THW graduate students has begun to emerge in their
  place. In 2013, new branches of THW were initiated at the University
  of Melbourne and the University of California, Berkeley (under the
  direction of Dr. Huff and Prof. Slaybaugh).

<h3>Condo of Condos</h3>
<p>
  The "Condo of Condos" consortium, led by Clemson University and
  including the University of Wisconsin &ndash; Madison and four other
  campuses during its pilot phase, has recently been recommended for
  funding by the National Science Foundation. The consortium's primary
  task is to build a network of advanced cyberinfrastructure research
  and education facilitators (ACI-REFs), with goals that include
  increasing the diversity of researchers using advanced cyber
  infrastructure on each campus and developing data science
  practitioners. The Software Carpentry workshops being designed under
  this proposal will serve those goals directly. As an investigator on
  both that project and this proposal, Prof. P. Wilson will engage the
  network of ACI-REFs to share this curriculum with both the initial
  consortium institutions and any institutions who are able to join in
  the future.
</p>
<h3>D-Lab</h3>
<p>
  D-Lab, located at the University of California, Berkeley, has the
  mission to create cross-disciplinary resources for high-level
  training and support services for social science researchers
  campus-wide. It does this by adaptively building new forms of shared
  infrastructure, including consulting and workshops in research tools
  and methods, and fostering discovery and connections with the pools
  of expertise and offerings of Berkeley's departments and
  professional schools. As a new research unit at Berkeley, D-lab has
  been actively involved in teaching software tools. D-lab is engaged
  in evaluating students' experiences with those trainings and
  adapting subsequent trainings in response to their
  evaluations. D-lab is an enthusiastic supporter of campus efforts to
  broaden this approach to teaching.
</p>
<p>
  D-lab will provide space, outreach, and assistance in locating and
  supporting the assessment position outlined in this
  proposal. Prof. Slaybaugh will engage with D-lab to capitalize on
  their expertise at the intersection assessment and scientific
  education.

<h2>Broader Impact</h2>
<p>
  We believe this work will have significant impact in several areas
  beyond directly improving the computational science skills of
  workshop participants.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <em>Enhance economic competitiveness.</em> Computing is no longer
    optional in any part of science: even scientists who don't think
    of themselves as doing computational work rely on computers to
    prepare papers, store data, and collaborate with colleagues. The
    better their computing skills are, the better prepared they will
    be to contribute to the research that underpins the nation's
    economic competitiveness.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Improving STEM education for everyone, not just
    participants.</em> By creating and validating high-quality open
    access teaching materials, and the methods used to deliver them,
    this project will enable improvement in STEM education for
    everyone, everywhere, not just for participating students and
    participating institutions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Improving STEM education tomorrow, not just today.</em> As
    noted in the introduction of this proposal, most of today's
    efforts to transfer computational skills to STEM researchers and
    connect them with 21st Century innovations in how science is done
    are flying blind: there is effectively no feedback from long-term
    impact to instructional action. By creating and validating such a
    feedback loop&mdash;i.e., by showing scientists how to apply
    science to their teaching&mdash;this project will demonstrate how
    STEM education can be continuously improved.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Improve participation in STEM by women and underrepresented
    minorities.</em> The disproportionately low participation of women
    and some minority groups in STEM is well documented, as is the
    fact that computing is one of the least diverse fields within
    STEM. This second fact creates a vicious cycle: people with weaker
    computing skills may be less competitive in research than their
    peers, which reduces their participation in activities viewed as
    non-core, which in turn results in them having weaker skills. This
    project will strive to break this cycle by giving at-risk students
    an opportunity to "level up" in a supportive environment and by
    connecting them with mentors who can serve as role models.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Career Management Plan</h2>
<p>
  The graduate students who are serving as mentors for the
  undergraduates at the different universities will each be paired
  with a local faculty mentor. The faculty mentor will meet regularly
  with the graduate student to discuss and problem solve any issues
  that the graduate student or undergraduates are having and to
  provide active mentoring on how to train students in computational
  approaches.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to engaging with the graduate students on their
  mentoring of the undergraduates, the faculty mentors will also serve
  as mentors for computational aspects of the graduate students'
  research and careers. In many areas of science,
  computationally-minded students are located in labs where the PIs do
  not have strong computational backgrounds. This means that they do
  not have a mentor to teach them about good computational practice in
  research. In addition, they do not have someone with whom to discuss
  computational careers, thus limiting their exposure to career paths
  outside of academia. Because the faculty mentors will have strong
  computational backgrounds themselves, they can fill this void for
  computationally-minded students.
