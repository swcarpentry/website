  A month ago I took part in the first face-to-face Software Carpentry
  Instructors Training run by Greg Wilson from Software Carpentry and
  <a href="https://twitter.com/warcode">Warren Code</a> from
  University of British Columbia. Unlike most of 40 participants, I
  had already completed
  the <a href="{{site.training_url}}">instructors course</a> which
  Greg regularly runs online.  My primary aim to attend the
  face-to-face training was to observe and learn how to run it because
  the plan is that the
  <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/">Software Sustainability
  Institute</a> (which I work for) will support running such training
  in the future.  So I attended the training in Toronto as a certified
  instructor and also as a Software Carpentry co-admin in the UK.
  Wearing different hats allowed me to look at the event from
  different perspectives and this is probably why it took me so long
  to write this post.

<p>
  Here is what I gained from the training.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Learning how to teach never ends </strong>
</p>
<p>
  As said I completed the second round of online instructors training in 2013.
  But over the course of 3 days at the Mozilla office where the training was hosted 
  I learnt yet a number of things that help me reflect on my teaching:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I very much enjoyed the University of Toronto's Jennifer Campbell's presentation on <em>flipped classroom</em> and the discussion that followed it. 
  </li>
  <li>
    I finally have enough concrete examples and arguments to try to convince people  that simply posting materials and videos online isn't going to solve the educational problems of this world. And it won't, on its own, address the issue of unequal access to education. But it can be very helpful when used wisely.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Backward lesson design</em> isn't the easiest thing to apply in practice when I'm trying to develop material (almost) from scratch. But this approach helps me a lot when I find myself in a mess of trying to teach everything at once not being able to priotirize and decide on the lesson layout and contents.
  </li>

<li>
  We used <em>concept maps</em> during the online training and since
  then I had a bit of ambivalent feelings about them. They were fun to
  create but pretty much useless when I looked at them a few days, let
  alone weeks, afterwards. I also struggled with interpreting the maps
  that others created. But it was at the instructors training in
  Toronto that I learnt that the maps are mainly useful to facilitate
  the thinking process rather than be a reference material.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>"Impostor syndrome stays with you forever"</strong>
</p>
<p>
  That's what Greg said and at first it got me really depressed. But
  then actually, it made me feel more comfortable with myself. It
  means that the fact that at every bootcamp I feel like "I don't have
  the qualification to teach this" is just a natural symptom of
  the <a href="https://counseling.caltech.edu/general/InfoandResources/Impostor">impostor
  syndrome</a>. There are a number of ways to deal with it. But I
  realized that the more I feel like an imposter, the more motivated I
  am to improve my knowledge and skills.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>"Those who can't do it go into teaching" is a lie</strong>
</p>
<p>
  I've heard that statement a number of times - not at the training in
  Toronto, no. Sometimes it was said just as a joke. Sometimes, with a
  bit of a cringy smile, it was said by Those Who Can Actually Do It -
  genius programmers and scientists. So yeah, maybe I can't do it and
  so I teach. But the people I met at the training in Toronto, they
  can definitely do it! They want to teach to pass on the useful
  skills to others and not because they are incapable of working with
  software and science.  That sweeping statement is simply not
  true.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>We need to work on Software Carpentry administration </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Together with Giacomo Peru of SSI, I co-administer Software
  Carpentry bootcamps in the UK. Having the experience of being an
  instructor and an administrator allows me to move around the
  Software Carpentry infrastructure pretty smoothly. But at the last
  session on Day 3 in Toronto when we discussed the practicalities of
  running a bootcamp, it was clear that even with the comprehensive
  operations guides, the instructors may get lost. And indeed, as it
  was discussed during
  the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/05/may-2014-lab-meeting-summary.html">recent
  lab call</a>, the work on improving the bootcamp management process
  are soon to start.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Software Carpentry folks are a great bunch :-)</strong>
</p>
<p>
  That is something I already knew before I went to Toronto. I have
  taught at over 12 bootcamps and writing this blog post made me
  realized that I always worked with different instructors! I've never
  taught with the same people twice. The same applies to the
  helpers. And, apart from instructing twice at the University of
  Manchester where I work, I went to different venues in the US and
  Europe and met a number of different hosts.  Software Carpentry
  people are fun, inspirational, impressive and very friendly. I'm
  really lucky to have an opportunity to hang out with them.  As an
  co-admin in the UK, I get to work with even larger pool of Software
  Carpentry folks - although, most of the interaction happens online.
  With Software Carpentry growing internationally bringing people
  together in one place is always going to be a major challenge but
  it's well worth it.  We all had a great time in Toronto!
