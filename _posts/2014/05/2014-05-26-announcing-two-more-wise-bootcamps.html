  Thanks to generous support from
  <a href="http://www.wil.com/">Waterfront International</a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.scm-lp.com/">Stevens Capital Management</a>,
  we are pleased to announce that we are running two bootcamps for women in science and engineering this summer:
  one in <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/2014-06-24-wise-penn/">Philadelphia</a> on June 24-25,
  and the other in <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/2014-07-08-wise-toronto/">Toronto</a> on July 8-9.
  Both bootcamps are open to female graduate students, post-docs, and faculty in science, engineering, and medicine,
  particularly those interested in analyzing large data,
  and build on previous WiSE bootcamps in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2013/06/after-wise.html">Boston in 2013</a>
  and <a href="http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/wise-athena-swifter-hermes/">Berkeley earlier this year</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
  Topics will include
  automating repetitive tasks with the Unix shell,
  developing modular programs in Python,
  collaborating and tracking work with Git, and
  managing data with SQL.
  Registration is now open for both <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/2014-06-24-wise-penn/">Philadelphia</a>
  and <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/2014-07-08-wise-toronto/">Toronto</a>;
