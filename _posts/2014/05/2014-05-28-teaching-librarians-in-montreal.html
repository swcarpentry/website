  Preston Holmes, Jessica Hamrick, Luke Lee, and I helped deliver a
  Software Carpentry bootcamp during the PyCon sprints in Montreal in
  April 2014. The audience consisted of roughly 35 librarians coming
  mostly from the Montreal area.

<p>
  Planning for this bootcamp was daunting. I had some experience
  teaching at Software Carpentry bootcamps (as did Preston and
  Jessica) but our material was almost exclusively directed at
  graduate students in science, not librarians. On top of that, the
  instructors were all scientists, so choosing appropriate motivating
  metaphors was difficult for us. We each spent some time prior to the
  bootcamp struggling to figure out appropriate materials we could use
  for an audience of librarians. As always, it was difficult to
  prepare to teach without a strong sense of what the students know
  already. We considered constructing examples using
  <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/open-access-bibliographic-records">Open
  Access bibliographic data sets</a> and
  using <a href="http://python.org/pypi/pymarc">pymarc</a> to process
  MARC records. We also considered scraping HTML or XML files as an
  example use case that librarians would find motivating.
</p>
<p>
  We taught the shell in the morning of the first day. We went fairly
  slowly discussing the basic model of interaction with a computer
  through the shell, standard file/directory commands, working with
  text editors, closing with a little bit of material on pipes,
  redirection and combining tools into scripts. We did not get all
  that far; in particular, we found ourselves trying to tie together a
  few commands into a script file but this was largely lost on the
  audience. We touched briefly on pipes and redirection, but, by and
  large, we didn't say much.
</p>
<p>
  The librarians, for the most part, had little experience working
  with command-line user interfaces and programming (although they
  were very comfortable with boolean operators and search
  queries). Actually, the feedback we received seemed to indicate that
  helping the participants set up a notional model of how files and
  directories work and what the shell actually does was one of the
  best features of the bootcamp for many of the them.
</p>
<p>
  In the afternoon of the first day, we started going through the
  basics of Python. The pace was quite fast starting from basic data
  types, lists, for loops, and going into using modules and writing or
  running scripts in Python versus interaction with the IPython
  shell. We avoided the IPython notebook due to set up issues and
  confusing learners with the model of execution. To close the day, we
  gave the learners an exercise to construct a Python script using
  command-line arguments.
</p>
<p>
  We asked for feedback at the end of the first day. There was an
  <em>overwhelming</em> consensus that we needed to slow down and to
  allocate more time for hands on stuff. There was confusion in what
  happens when one is using the bash shell versus the IPython shell or
  the generic Python shell. In switching between these, we were losing
  some of the people. In retrospect, our expectations of how quickly
  the audience could internalise and apply programming concepts were
  far too ambitious.
</p>
<p>
  In response to the feedback from day 1, we recapitulated most of the
  ideas in the morning of day 2 (pointing to the Software Carpentry
  website for more resources). Refreshing the material on the Unix
  shell went quickly because the participants seemed comfortable with
  most of that. We did spend some time describing our own mental
  processes when running distinct shells concurrently. In revisiting
  Python, we discussed lists again with methods and for loops much
  more slowly and in more detail (using slides
  from <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/lessons/previous/">V4 lessons</a> to illustrate). We
  initially intended to spend only half an hour doing a recap;
  instead, we spend most of the morning going till just 45 minutes
  before the lunch break.
</p>
<p>
  The rest of day 2 was spent on a single collaborative exercise. The
  participants had asked for more time for hands on work so this
  seemed like a good approach. Together, we built a Python script to
  address <a href="https://github.com/jhamrick/library-exercise">a
  brilliantly simple use case</a> that Jessica dreamed up during the
  morning. Jessica had manually transcribed data from an image of a
  library circulation card into a text file. The text file had a
  two-line header (the Title and Authour) followed by rows of due
  dates when the book was due back. The dates were inconsistent but
  only in three different ways. That is, they were given in the format
  Month-Day-Year separated by spaces. The Months were all expressed in
  three character abbriviated form. The dates were inconsistent but
  only in three ways: the year was either four digits
  (e.g., <code>1962</code>) or two digits (e.g., <code>62</code>) or
  two digits preceded by an apostrophe (e.g., <code>'62</code>). The
  dates also ranged only between the 1950s and 1960s (so no Y2K
  issues).
</p>
<p>
  In hindsight, Jessica's reduction to a data set corrupted in limited
  ways was the smartest choice. We were making matters too complicated
  for novices in playing with MARC files or more complicated tasks. In
  reducing a feasible use case of cleaning a meaningful dirty data set
  into one that is cleaner, we were able to construct a lengthy script
  incrementally. Logical questions arose about more complicated
  corruptions (e.g., <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> vs. <code>MM-DD-YY</code>
  vs. <code>DD-MM-YY</code>, etc.)  but the audience was satisfied
  with hearing that is more advanced (i.e., requiring regular
  expressions) that we can extend this script to deal with later.
</p>
<p>
  In finishing up before lunch of day 2, we started developing the
  script explaining at the same time how to do file I/O. This
  dovetailed well with the earlier description of files in the Unix
  shell and how to navigate directories. By lunch, we had a working
  script that opened the file, loaded its contents into a list, closed
  it, and printed out the list.
</p>
<p>
  At this point, we had lost Luke and Preston leaving Jessica and I to
  cover for the rest of the afternoon. Over lunch, Jessica and I
  discussed strategy. We had the idea of using this script to motivate
  version control with git coupled with incremental development. This
  also worked really well since, rather than introducing git in the
  abstract, we had a concrete problem that the audience had already
  engaged with.
</p>
<p>
  After lunch, we made sure everyone had git installed before
  returning to the script. There were some installation headaches (the
  latest git binaries for Mac didn't work on all hardware). I tried to
  trouble-shoot this but was not much help. In fact, one of the
  librarians, being persistent, figured out which git binary was
  appropriate, posted a link on the etherpad and, before long, most of
  those who had struggled with getting git installed on their Mac had
  it running (this was independent of my fumbled attempts).
</p>
<p>
  With git running, Jessica was building the script at the front of
  the room and we jointly guided the development with frequent
  commits, explaining the process. There was the usual headache of
  explaining the syntax of git, but having spent enough time on the
  shell beforehand, the audience could cope. With each change, we kept
  the entire group in sync. Occasionally, I would check out to see
  where I could help someone who couldn't get it right (usually a line
  miscopied).
</p>
<p>
  At one point, we had a teachable moment: two of the participants
  accidentally overwrote the data file with an empty file. They had
  both made the same copy-and-paste error in using the same file for
  input and output. Fortunately, we had already introduced version
  control with git! We got everyone to repeat the same mistake so that
  they overwrote their input file with an empty file. Once we all
  verified that we had erased our data, we recovered the backup from
  the repository using git checkout. This actually reinforced the
  value of version control for backup as well as incremental
  development.
</p>
<p>
  We went straight to the end of the day working on this single script
  (that was about 80 lines long at the end including comments). The
  audience was incredibly engaged and every single person left in the
  room got it working! This was a new experience for me (with almost
  20 years experience teaching at the post-secondary level) and it
  felt fantastic. As an academic instructor, it is embarrassingly easy
  to fall into the trap of trying to cover too mucgh content. What
  happened at this bootcamp is that we didn't actually over much
  content. My feeling, however, is that the participants collectively
  got enough of a meaningful learning experience that they could
  manage on their own from then on. Librarians in general are pretty
  good at working in the gaps between disciplines and are pretty
  determined to figure things out; what I learned from this experience
  is how to use their strengths constructively.
