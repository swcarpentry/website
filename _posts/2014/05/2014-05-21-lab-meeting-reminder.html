  Our monthly lab meeting will take place on Thursday, May 22 at 10:00 am and again at 7:00 pm, Eastern time.
  There's a lot to discuss,
  so please take a moment beforehand to go through
  <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-labmeeting">the lab meeting Etherpad</a>
  and see if there are any pull requests or enhancement proposals that you are particularly interested in.
</p>
<p>
  We look forward to seeing you online.
