  A lot of people work behind the scenes to organize bootcamps,
  keep our website going (and readable),
  and generally make it possble for the rest of us to do what we do.
  I'd therefore like to offer some long-overdue thanks to
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#brown.amy">Amy Brown</a>,
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#collins.arliss">Arliss Collins</a>,
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#cabunoc.abigail">Abby Cabunoc</a>,
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#gonzalez.ivan">Ivan Gonzalez</a>,
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#pipitone.j">Jon Pipitone</a>,
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#rio.david">David Rio</a>,
  and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#silva.raniere">Raniere Silva</a>
  for all their hard work:
  we wouldn't have come this far without them,
  and we're very grateful for everything they've done.
