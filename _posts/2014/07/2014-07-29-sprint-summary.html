  Last week,
  the <a href="{{site.msl_url}}">Mozilla Science Lab</a> hosted its first-ever global sprint.
  Dozens of people joined in from 18 cities (and a few from home)
  to work for two days on a wide variety of projects,
  ranging from new lessons to tools for mining the scientific literature.
  The <a href="{{site.msl_url}}/the-mozsprint-heard-round-the-world/">MSL blog</a> has all the details,
  and will have a series of posts about what was done over the next couple of weeks,
  but here are a few Software Carpentry-specific highlights:
