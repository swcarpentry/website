On 21-23 July, <a href="http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk">EPCC</a>'s <a href="http://www.archer.ac.uk">ARCHER</a> training team visited a sun-drenched <a href="http://www.cranfield.ac.uk">Cranfield University</a> to run a <a href="http://hpcarcher.github.io/2014-07-21-cranfield/">Software Carpentry bootcamp and Introduction to Scientific Programming in Python</a>. The 3 days combined a traditional bootcamp with a new day course providing an Introduction to Scientific Programming in Python.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
We covered shell hints and tips, version control and Git, and end-to-end and unit testing in Python. Our Introduction to Scientific Programming in Python included NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Cython and mpi4py, using a computational fluid dynamics code as an example.
</p>
<p>
We had 28 attendees, mostly from Cranfield itself, with few attendees from further afield including Heriot Watt, Queen Mary University of London, Greenwich, Sheffield, the National Oceanography Centre and even Berkeley. And, as is traditional on bootcamps, we gathered feedback on the good points and bad points of the bootcamp:

<p>
As an instructor, asides from my low tolerance to extreme heat, the main challenge was screen real estate - and a tension between font size and what is visible at any time. As a result, attendees sometimes missed what I was typing at my command prompt as I'd switch to my editor. In later sessions, I tried to paste everything to the EtherPad as I went, which both gave time for attendees to catch up and helped me not go so fast!
</p>
<p>
Due to the unexpectedly heat of our room, our local hosts, Mark Stillwell and Robert Sawko, did a great job in getting us another room for some of our sessions, and we relocated to the cooler climes of the second when it was free.

ARCHER's training team will be running more bootcamps in the coming months, and members of our team will be attending the <a href="http://www.tgac.ac.uk/software-carpentry-instructor-training/">Software Carpentry: Instructor Training</a> at <a href="http://www.tgac.ac.uk">TGAC</a> this October. We look forward to reporting on our experiences.
