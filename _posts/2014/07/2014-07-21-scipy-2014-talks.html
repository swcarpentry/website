  Talks from SciPy 2014 are 
  <a href="http://pyvideo.org/category/51/scipy-2014">now online</a>,
  and include several from people associated with Software Carpentry.
  I particularly enjoyed <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2719/keynote-lorena-barba">Lorena Barba's keynote</a>,
  in which she discussed how she's using the IPython Notebook in a flipped classroom.
  (I gave a talk <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2812/software-carpentry-lessons-learned-0">too</a>,
  but if you're a regular reader of this blog,
  you'll have heard most of it already.)

  My biggest take-away wasn't the talks, though.
  Instead,
  it was <a href="https://wrightaprilm.github.io/posts/lonely.html">this brave post</a> by April Wright:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Last night,
  at the Software Carpentry mixer,
  a grand total of 5 men shook my husband's hand and ignored mine.
  My total of new people met is a dismal ten.
  Compare it to the Evolution meetings,
  which is 'my' meeting,
  where I met upwards of 40 new people,
  had a blast,
  and was treated by all participants like a member of the community.

  There's follow-up <a href="https://wrightaprilm.github.io/posts/help-out.html">here</a>
  and <a href="http://andy.terrel.us/blog/2014/07/17/">here</a> (and elsewhere),
  but as someone who was at that mixer I think the message is clear:
  we need to do better,
  both as individuals and as a community.
