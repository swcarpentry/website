  16 years ago,
  Jon Udell wrote a white paper titled
  "<a href="http://jonudell.net/GroupwareReport.html">Internet Groupware for Scientific Collaboration</a>"
  that profoundly changed how I thought about the web.
  In many ways,
  it seems as futuristic today as it did then:
  despite all the technological advances of the last decade and a half,
  a two-way web built on top of a universal canvas is still mostly a dream.
</p>
<p>
  Udell and others are now working on <a href="https://thali.codeplex.com/">Thali</a>,
  an attempt to create a truly distributed web.
  It,
  and projects like Ward Cunningham's <a href="http://fed.wiki.org/">Smallest Federated Wiki</a>,
  are a more truly open model for science
  than the de facto centralization typified by Google, Facebook, Twitter, and GitHub,
  but it's not clear we'll choose the long-term robustness of the former
  over the short-term convenience of the latter.
</p>
<p>
  I asked Jon if I could re-post <em>IGSC</em> here.
  He said yes,
  but on reflection,
  I realized that doing so would run counter to the spirit of
  <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2011/01/24/seven-ways-to-think-like-the-web/">what he's been trying to tell us</a>.
  Instead,
  I urge you to <a href="http://jonudell.net/GroupwareReport.html">click on this link</a>
  and marvel at the everyday miracle that follows.
