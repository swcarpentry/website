  Setup and configuration is often the biggest challenge bootcamp participants face,
  particularly on Windows.
  Our installation instructions are pretty good,
  but to make them better,
  <a href="http://justinkitzes.com/">Justin Kitzes</a> has started building
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">a wiki page</a>
  on GitHub
  to keep track of what's gone wrong and what fixes have worked.
  Many thanks to Justin for getting the ball rolling&mdash;contributions would be very welcome.
