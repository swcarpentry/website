  Sooner or later,
  in every discussion of open science,
  someone will say there's a risk of being scooped
  if you share your code or data with your peers.
  I think this is pure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD</a>:
  in all the years I've worked with scientists,
  I have never met anyone this has actually happened to.
</p>
<p>
  But absence of proof is not proof of absence,
  so I'd like to issue a challenge.
  If someone has ever published a result you were going to
  by taking advantage of software or data that you made publicly available,
  I'll send you a Software Carpentry t-shirt.
  You'll need to provide specifics,
  but I won't share those details with anyone without your permission.
  Please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">mail me</a> if you'd like to chat.
