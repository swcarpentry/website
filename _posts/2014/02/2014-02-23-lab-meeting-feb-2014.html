  We're having our first lab meeting of 2014 this week.
  As usual, we'll hold it twice to accommodate different time zones:
  once at 20:00 Eastern on Wednesday, February 26,
  and again at 11:00 Eastern on Thursday, February 27.
  Connection details will be posted on <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-labmeeting">the meeting's Etherpad</a>,
  and everyone is welcome both to attend and to add agenda items to the 'pad beforehand.
