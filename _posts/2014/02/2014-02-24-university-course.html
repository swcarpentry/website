  <em>I recently submitted my final assignment for the
  <a href="http://gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/SCTGR.html">Specialist Certificate in Teaching
  for Graduate Researchers</a>. For this final task, we were asked to design a curriculum
  document for a university subject that we would like to see taught in the future. The
  first thing that came to mind was Software Carpentry, so here's my take on what a bootcamp
  would look like, if it were to become an actual university course.</em>

<p><strong>Commentary</strong></p>
<p>
  In today's web-enabled world of big data, we are collecting, processing and storing more
  data than ever before. The answers to many fascinating and previously intractable
  questions lie within these data, however extracting them is a non-trivial task. Due to
  their vast size and complexity, modern research datasets have largely outgrown simple
  data analysis packages like Microsoft Excel. Since their work typically requires
  significant domain-specific knowledge, researchers are therefore increasingly left to
  write their own data analysis software (or code), even though most have little formal
  training in software development. For example, recent studies suggest that modern
  scientists spend 30% or more of their time developing software, but 90% are primarily
  self-taught (<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1556904.1556928">Hannay et al, 2009</a>;
  <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2063348.2063374">Prabhu et al, 2011</a>).
  They therefore lack exposure to basic software development practices such as version
  control, code reviews, unit testing, and task automation.
</p>
<p>
  This lack of computational competency has no doubt contributed to the current
  irreproducibility crisis in published research
  (e.g. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7386/abs/nature10836.html">Ince et al., 2012</a>),
  not to mention a number of high profile retractions of published results
  (e.g. <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5807/1856">Miller, 2006</a>). In an
  attempt to address this problem, the
  <a href="https://its.unimelb.edu.au/research">Information Technology Services (ITS)</a>
  Research Services department at The University of Melbourne ran a Software Carpentry bootcamp for staff
  and students in November 2013
  (see <a href="http://resbaz.tumblr.com/post/73029044458/the-hacker-within-research-community-launched-in">summary</a>).
  This four-afternoon course introduced researchers to current best practices in
  computational research (<a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001745">Wilson et al., 2014</a>).
  It proved to be very popular (over 30 people attended), so there are plans to hold a
  number of similar bootcamps in 2014.
</p>
<p>
  The ultimate goal for ITS Research Services is to get all university staff and students
  using computational best practices in their data intensive research. Given the global
  success of the Software Carpentry project, it seems likely that future bootcamps will
  continue to be well attended, however so long as attendance is voluntary it is unlikely
  that this goal of reaching <em>all</em> researchers will be achieved. The proposed new
  subject, <em>Software Carpentry for Data Intensive Research</em>, takes the bootcamp
  concept (and materials) and recasts it into a formal university subject. It will be
  compulsory for all Research Higher Degree students conducting data intensive research,
  thus eliminating the current situation where bootcamp attendance is limited to highly
  motivated students who managed to hear about the event through colleagues or social
  media.
</p>
<p>
  An even more compelling reason for running a formal university subject is the
  opportunity for assessment. As noted in a recent review of the Software Carpentry
  project (<a href="http://f1000research.com/articles/3-62/v2">Wilson, 2016</a>), two
  major problems have been low participation in follow-up initiatives (e.g. online office
  hours) and an inability for project coordinators to know/ensure that researchers are
  actually applying the teachings in their own research. Since assessment is central to
  the student learning experience and tends to define what they see as important
  (e.g. <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02602930903512883#.Uwls1Puhbdc">Price et al., 2011</a>),
  it provides a means by which to remedy these problems.
</p>
<p><strong>Subject Curriculum: Software Carpentry for Data Intensive Research</strong></p>
<p><em>Overview</em></p>
<p>
  Modern researchers are spending more and more time building and using software, yet
  most are self-taught programmers. As a result, they spend hours doing things that
  should take minutes, reinvent a lot of wheels, and still can't be sure that their
  results are reliable. This subject introduces students to a set of best practices for
  software development which has solid foundations in research and experience and
  improves both productivity and software reliability. It is not expected that students
  will be professional software 'engineers' by the end of the subject, but they will be
  using basic software 'carpentry' skills in their day-to-day research.
</p>
<p><em>Expectations and prerequisites</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Students must be in the first 12-months of a data intensive Research Higher
    Degree. Their supervisor is responsible for classifying their research project as
    data intensive and thus recommending them for the subject.</li>
  <li>The semester long subject consists of approximately 20 contact hours delivered
    during one intensive week at the beginning of semester. The formal (i.e. graded)
    assessment then takes place at the very end of semester (i.e. 3-4 months hence).</li>
  <li>Students are encouraged to bring their own laptops with a number of free and
    open source software packages installed (instructions and support will be provided
    prior to the first class). By teaching on personal laptops (as opposed to in a
    computer lab), there is no impediment to students immediately applying what they
    learn in their own research. All exercises during the intensive week are completed
    in pairs, so students who do not own a laptop will be paired with someone who does.</li>
  <li>It is expected that in the time between the intensive week and the graded
    assessment, students will begin to apply what they have learned in their own
    research, drawing on support services such as
    the <a href="https://github.com/resbaz/hackerwin">The Hacker Within</a> student
    group as required.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Learning objectives</em></p>
<p>
  Upon completion of the subject students will be applying computational best practices
  in their own research. In particular, they will be:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the shell to perform basic tasks such as searching their file system and
    automating repetitive tasks.</li>
  <li>Writing data analysis scripts that apply programming best practices such as the
    use of functions, defensive programming (e.g. using assertions) and scripts that parse the command line.</li>
  <li>Testing their code, when appropriate, using a formal testing library.</li>
  <li>Using a version control system (i.e. git, svn or mercurial) to back-up and
    capture a complete revision history of their code.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  More generally, the students will also:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Demonstrate an ability to exercise a high level of independence, initiative and
    self guidance in their data analysis.</li>
  <li>Be able to articulate simple explanations of the key barriers to reproducible
    computational research and the options available for overcoming them.</li>
  <li>Be able to participate in code review, both as a submitter of code and a reviewer.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><em>Schedule and teaching and learning approaches</em></p>
<p>
  The daily schedule for the intensive week will be:
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td>09:30 - 10:30:</td><td>Tutors available for general assistance</td></tr>
  <tr><td>10:30 - 10:45:</td><td>Morning tea</td></tr>
  <tr><td>10:45 - 12:30:</td><td>Coursework</td></tr>
  <tr><td>12:30 - 13:30:</td><td>Lunch</td></tr>
  <tr><td>13:30 - 15:00:</td><td>Coursework</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
  The coursework involves a series of 10-15 minute periods of demonstration (live coding)
  from the lead instructor, interspersed with various challenges/exercises/quizzes that
  are completed in pairs. During the coursework sessions, tutors (at a ratio of about one
  tutor to every six students) will circulate the room answering questions and providing
  feedback on student answers to the challenges. The teaching content can be broken down
  into four major sections:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/lessons/#shell">The Shell</a> (Monday)</li>
  <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/lessons/#python">Programming like a programmer</a> (Tuesday and Wednesday)</li>
  <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/lessons/#git">Version control</a> (Thursday)</li>
  <li>Context and assessment (Friday)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The final section on context and assessment places the content of the previous four
  days in the context of broader topics like open access, reproducibility in computational
  research, and ongoing professional development. In fact, since the assessment tasks
  require students to actively participate in an open and reproducible workflow, these
  tasks are introduced along with a lesson on the tools required to complete them. Since
  the ongoing learning/development process for researchers who write code is somewhat
  independent and self-guided, the support services available to assist this process are
  also introduced (e.g. The Hacker Within postgraduate programming society, web-based
  help forums like Stack Overflow and key mailing lists).
</p>
<p><em>Assessment</em></p>
<p>
  During the one-week intensive course tutors will provide feedback and assistance on the
  challenges, but no formal grades will be allocated. On the final day of the course the
  three graded assessment tasks will be introduced (see below). It should be noted that
  the grading of these tasks focuses on ensuring that students have made a genuine and
  ongoing attempt at using computational best practices in their research. It is not
  expected that students will be writing "perfect" code by the end of the semester.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Task 1: Code peer review</u>
  <br/>
  Students are required to upload a script of their choice to
  <a href="http://codebrag.com/">Codebrag</a> so that it can be reviewed by their partner.
  It must be a script that they are using in their own research. In return, they must
  also review their partner's script.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Submission process:</em> Students must email the relevant Codebrag URL to
    the subject coordinator.</li>
  <li><em>Due date:</em> Three months after the one-week intensive coursework.</li>
  <li><em>Assessment criteria:</em> This is a hurdle requirement and a pass contributes
    a full 20% to the overall grade for the subject. The subject coordinator will simply
    check that the student has made a genuine attempt at both submitting a script worthy
    of review and providing considered feedback for their partner. The coordinator will
    also provide some commentary on the script, which will assist the student with the
    remaining tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <u>Task 2: Code repository</u>
  <br/>
  Students are required to maintain a version-controlled repository of their research
  code (e.g. using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>,
  <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> or
  <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>) that is linked to an external
  hosting service (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>,
  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>).
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Submission process:</em> Students must email the (publicly available) URL for
    the homepage of their externally hosted code repository to the subject coordinator.</li>
  <li><em>Due date:</em> Four months after the one-week intensive coursework.</li>
  <li><em>Assessment criteria:</em> This is a hurdle requirement and a pass contributes
    a full 20% to the overall grade for the subject. The subject coordinator will view the
    publicly available statistics on the site (e.g. commit activity) to check that the
    student has been using version control consistently. They will also provide suggestions
    on how the student's usage could be improved.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <u>Task 3: Formal code review</u>
  <br/>
  Students are required to upload a data analysis script of their choice, including an
  accompanying testing library and example data, to
  <a href="http://www.runmycode.org/">RunMyCode.org</a>. They must be using the script in
  their own research.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Submission process:</em> Students must email the (publicly available) URL for
    their RunMyCode.org homepage to the subject coordinator.</li>
  <li><em>Due date:</em> Four months after the one-week intensive coursework.</li>
  <li><em>Assessment criteria:</em> This exercise is graded and is worth 60% of the
    final grade. Students must achieve a passing grade on this task in order to pass
    the subject. It will be marked according to the degree to which the script/s apply
    the best practices introduced in the subject and also the appropriateness and
    coverage of the testing library.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  To assist students in understanding the requirements of these assessment tasks,
  examples of good code review, repository usage and RunMyCode.org submissions will be
  provided. Students can apply for an extension (due two months after the intensive week)
  if the early stages of their research project will not involve much programming (e.g.
  they might be doing fieldwork instead). It is also possible to make alternative
  assessment arrangements if their code and/or data cannot be open access.
