  If you have friends or colleagues in or near Montreal,
  please let them know that we're running
  <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pycon-montreal-software-carpentry-bootcamp-registration-10151376039">our largest bootcamp ever</a>
  on April 14-15 in conjunction with <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/">PyCon 2014</a>.
  Material will include our usual topics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Unix shell (and how to automate repetitive tasks);</li>
  <li>Git and GitHub (and how to use version control to track and share work);</li>
  <li>Python or R (and how to grow a program in a structured, testable, reusable way); and</li>
  <li>databases (and the difference between structured and unstructured data).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  but we'll split people between several rooms based on how much they already know
  so that each group can move at its own pace.

  sequencing</a> (NGS) and other topics in bioinformatics using
  Python.  The April 15 class, which will be taught by Prof. Ramnath
  Vaidyanathan, will be an
  <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pycon-montreal-r-for-pythonistas-master-class-by-software-carpentry-registration-10319320365">introduction
  to R</a> for Python programmers.

  In addition to the tools and techniques you'll learn in these
  workshops, this is an opportunity to meet more than 150 other
  scientists who are using the same tools and facing the same
  challenges as you.  We encourage you to sign up in pairs or groups
  so that you have friends to work with at the workshop, and can
  support one another when you're back at your desk applying what
  you've learned.
