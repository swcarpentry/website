<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>
  We had the wrap-up meetings for Round 7 of instructor training this past Thursday.
  The full summary is <a href="{{site.training_url}}/2014/02/07/wrapping-up-round-7/">on the training blog</a>,
  but the key points are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <em>We need to include a lesson early in the course on the structure of the materials in our repository, and how to configure things for a workshop.</em>
    We'll do a trial run on Thursday, February 20, in the usual time slots (10:00, 14:00, and 19:00 Eastern);
    please have a look at the <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-teaching">Etherpad</a> for connection details on the day.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>People want a chance to watch more experienced teachers in action.</em>
    One possibility would be to set up something like
    <a href="https://beasmartercookie.com/">SmarterCookie</a>
    or
    <a href="http://www.edthena.com/">Edthena</a>,
    where teachers upload videos of themselves in action so that other people can comment on what they do and how they do it.
    We will think about ways and means and see what we can set up in the next couple of weeks.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Our thanks once again to everyone who stayed with us through what turned out to be a longer-than-usual run of the course:
  I look forward to teaching with you all some day soon.
</p>
<p>
  Finally,
  there are still seats available for the
  <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/software-carpentry-instructor-training-registration-9481333925">live three-day version</a>
  of the instructor training course,
  which will run in Toronto on April 28-30, 2014.

  and teaching programming in specific,
