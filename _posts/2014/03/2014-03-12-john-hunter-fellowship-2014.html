  The John Hunter Technology Fellowship aims to bridge the gap between academia
  and real-world, open-source scientific computing projects
  by providing a capstone experience for individuals coming from a scientific educational background.
  The program consists of a 6 month project-based training program for postdoctoral scientists or senior graduate students.
  Fellows work on scientific computing open source projects under the guidance of mentors
  who are leading scientists and software engineers.
  The aim of the Fellowship is to enable Fellows to develop
  the skills needed to contribute to cutting-edge open source software projects
  while at the same time advancing or supporting the research program they and their mentor are involved in.

<p>
  The Fellow receives an award of $33,000,
  which is meant to support the Fellow for 6 months of full-time work;
  The Fellowship can be started in the July 2014 - Jan 2015 time frame,
  and applications are due May 15, 2014.
