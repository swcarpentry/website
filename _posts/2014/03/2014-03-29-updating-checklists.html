<h2>This post originally appeared on the [Software Carpentry website](https://software-carpentry.org/)</h2>
<p>
  We have updated our checklists for bootcamp
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/checklists/admin/">administrators</a>,
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/checklists/host/">hosts</a>,
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/checklists/instructor/">instructors</a>
  (and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/checklists/lead/">lead instructors</a>),
  and
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/checklists/helper/">helpers</a>.
  Further improvements are welcome,
  and we'd appreciate comments on this post
  suggesting items we could put in a checklist for learners.
