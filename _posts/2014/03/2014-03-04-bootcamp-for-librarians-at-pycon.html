  We are very pleased to announce that we will be running a two-day workshop
  on programming skills for librarians
  during the PyCon sprints in Montreal on April 14 and 15, 2014.
  The workshop will introduce participants to core skills for managing and manipulating data,
  including task automation, version control, modular programming, and databases.
