    We're really happy to be offering childcare services for the first
    time, available Friday through Sunday of the conference. Thanks to
    the Python Software Foundation's subsidy, the cost per day is $50.

    Another new event for 2014 is a set of dinners we've put together
    on Friday. After the day's talks have ended, hosts Brandon Rhodes and
