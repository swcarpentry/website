  Via Sumana Harihareswara:
  the Community Data Science Workshops are a series of project-based workshops
  being held at the University of Washington
  for anyone interested in learning how to use programming and data science tools
  to ask and answer questions about online communities
  like Wikipedia, Twitter, free  and open source software, and civic media.
</p>
<p>
  The workshops are for people with no previous programming experience.
  The goal is to bring together both researchers and academics
  as well as participants and leaders in online communities.
  The workshops will all be free of charge.
  Participants from outside UW are encouraged to apply.
</p>
<p>
  There will be three workshops held from 9am-4pm on three Saturdays in April and May.
  Each session will involve a period for lecture and technical demonstrations in the morning.
  This will be followed by a lunch graciously provided by
  the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/">eSciences Institute at UW</a>.
  The rest  of the day will be followed by group work on programming and data science projects
  supported by more experienced mentors.
