  Titus Brown and Ethan White led a half-hour discussion today of
  the minimal online presence people in academia ought to have.
  Notes from the call are below;
  to make a point-form story even pointier,
  please make yourself findable and shareable.

<p>Things Titus &amp; Ethan think are important for your (minimally sufficient) online presence</p>
<ul>
  <li>Motivation: tried to track down info on Software Carpentry associated folk for computational science hires. Had a tough time!</li>
  <li>My opinion: within space of one reasonably-phrased google search, someone should be able to casually find
    <ul>
      <li>Email address, CV in PDF form, research interests, and publication list/citations.</li>
      <li>Personal research writings (grad/post-doc applications, etc.)</li>
      <li>Searcher can then pass on to make a case for hiring/interviewing etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This can be done with github and google scholar fairly easily.
    <ul>
      <li>Don't need to keep everything up to date all the time</li>
      <li>But should update at every important milestone (e.g., changing position, publishing really important paper)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A PDF form of CV is important for forwarding around... doesn't need to be completely up to date, google scholar can keep that, but important milestones.</li>
  <li>Presentation about automatically maintaining presence: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/c.titus.brown/2014-beacontoolsforscience">http://www.slideshare.net/c.titus.brown/2014-beacontoolsforscience</a></li>
  <li>More generally, for social media: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/c.titus.brown/2013-beaconcongresssocialmedia">this presentation</a>
  </li>
  <li>CV should contain
    <ul>
      <li>training/position history</li>
      <li>summary of research interests</li>
      <li>funding and paper information</li>
      <li>important things to read</li>
      <li>online links; workshops and training; invitations; professional activities; references</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>E.g.:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/ethanwhite/CV/blob/master/CV.md">Ethan's CV</li></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/ctb/resume/blob/master/full-CV.pdf">Titus's CV</a></li>
      <li>Greg's <a href="http://third-bit.com/about.html">summary</a> and <a href="http://third-bit.com/greg-wilson.html">CV</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>for goodness sake, if you are a software carpentry instructor SAY SO somewhere!</li>
  <li>really easy website builder <a href="http://www.staceyapp.com/">http://www.staceyapp.com/</a> or use GitHub sites/pages</li>
  <li>Wordpress.com is also a really easy way to build a nice looking personal website</li>
</ul>

<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Should people include links/mentions for code? If so, what/how? CTB: can't hurt! TH: I give a link to my github account</li>
  <li>convention for order of topics in CV might depend on field? CTB: no fixed conventions AFAIK, EPW: put the stuff that matters most first (&amp; what matters most varies based on what you want to do professionally) SH: reverse chron!</li>
  <li>What if a lot of the code you develop is only viewable within your institution? Most of the code on my github is pretty old</li>
  <li>Should we have an area where folks can post links to their "presence"? As an example.
    <ul>
      <li>We're very happy to include links to personal sites/home pages in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/">the team list</a></li>
      <li>Please send to Greg, or send pull requests against the 'site' repo</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For a personal website how long/detailed should your research interests be?
    <ul>
      <li>Check out <a href="http://greatlabwebsites.tumblr.com/">http://greatlabwebsites.tumblr.com/</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For non OA articles, do you link to the journal website (doi), to a pre/post-print, or to the published article (illegally, technically)? (Or in which order of preference)
    <ul>
      <li>CTB: google scholar solves this problem pretty well :). Make sure to the best of your ability that your important papers are available somewhere/somehow. That having been said most professors will have access to most major journals, even if closed access.</li>
      <li>EPW: I use my institutional repository and put post-prints there and link to them (these then get indexed w/the paper in Google Scholar)</li>
      <li>SH: I post illegal links too and wait for publisher to complain</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Personal/lab web sites worth looking at:
