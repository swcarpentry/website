  The reproducibility@XSEDE workshop is a full-day event scheduled for Monday, July 14, 2014 in Atlanta, Georgia.
  The workshop will take place in conjunction with <a href="http://conferences.xsede.org">XSEDE14</a>,
  the annual conference of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment,
  and will feature an interactive,
  open-ended,
  discussion-oriented agenda focused on reproducibility in large-scale computational science.
  We hope to help promote a culture of reproducibility within the broad community of stakeholders
  connected to computation-enabled research,
  and expect our work to lead to recommendations address to this community.
</p>
<p>
  This event will build on the 2009 <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~vcs/Conferences/RoundtableNov212009/">Yale Data and Code Sharing Roundtable</a>,
  which culminated in a declaration
  "demanding a resolution to the credibility crisis from the lack of reproducible research in computational science".
