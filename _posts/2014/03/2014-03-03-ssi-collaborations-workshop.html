<p>The <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">Software Sustainability Institute</a> is running the annual 
<a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/cw14">Collaborations Workshop</a> (CW14) on 26-28 March in Oxford. 
The event brings together researchers, software developers, managers and funders to explore important ideas in software 
and research and to plant the seed of interdisciplinary collaborations. The theme this  year is "Software in your reproducible 
research" and  we also have a hackday!</p>

<p>To register for CW14 or the CW Hackday, visit the <a href="http://www.epay.ed.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&modid=2&catid=87&prodid=1420">
registration page</a>.</p>

<p>There are lots of reasons why you should attend:</p>

<ul>
<li>GitHub and Microsoft Research will be on hand with the latest advice on using repositories, 
the cloud and open-source collaborative tooling for your research software.</li>

<li> There will be prizes! The top team of the hackday win tablets! And there is more for the runner-ups.
</li>

<li>A good tranche of the <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/fellows">Institute's Fellows</a> will be attending. Not only are they leaders in their fields, 
they also have a particular interest in research software and its promotion in their domains. Even
if you are not from the same domain, the Fellows have learnt some valuable lessons about using software in research.</li>

<li>You will get a chance to hear lightning talks about a huge range of fascinating subjects, and perhaps 
you could promote your own work, highlight a particular bugbear or make a pitch for the hackday.</li>

<li>We will also be having the conference dinner in the historic - and rather fancy - hall
at St John's college.</li>

<li>The Software Sustainability Institute team will be on hand, so if you are interested 
in running a <a href="http://software.ac.uk/software-carpentry">Software Carpentry</a> bootcamp 
or want to learn how to <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2014-01-23-spread-word-better-software-better-research">
make better software for better research</a>, come along!</li>

<li>The hackathon will have a pizza evening where you can pitch ideas, form or join a team, and get underway 
with potentially 24 hours of coding... and the chance of winning prizes.</li>

<li> You will be interacting with funders, researchers, developers,a publishers, managers and administrators; 
the whole spectrum of people dealing with software in research. You will gain an understanding of how 
people are working effectively together and come home with an up to date understanding of how people are approaching
software to support reproducible research.</li>

</ul>

<p>So learn from other people, promote what you do, come up with ideas and maybe win prizes, 
but most of all have an enjoyable and informed time. We hope to see you at CW14!</p>
