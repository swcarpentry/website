  Yesterday,
  the New York Times R&amp;D Lab <a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-streamtools/">announced streamtools</a>,
  a web-based graphical tool for working with streams of data.
  It lets users create dataflow systems to re-mix and process
  the streams they believe most data will consist of in the near future.
</p>
<p>
  Streamtools looks nice,
  but I do have some questions:
</p>
<!--more-->
<ol>
  <li>
    What does it offer that <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Yahoo! Pipes</a> didn't seven years ago?
  </li>
  <li>
    (How) have they addressed Pipes' shortcomings?  (See for example the <a href="http://neverworkintheory.org/2011/06/27/refactoring-pipe-like-mashups-for-end-user-programmers.html">Stolee and Elbaum paper</a> from 2011, or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2011/09/the-simplest-web-that-could-possibly-work.html">my post</a> from 2011 about <a href="https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That</a> for science.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Why would I use any of these systems rather than something like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Live-Web-Event-Based-Connections/dp/1133686680">Kinetic Rules Language</a>?
  </li>
  <li>
    Why will people who <em>don't</em> use Pipes, IFTTT, or KRL (which is almost all of us) use streamtools?
  </li>
</ol>
