  We are very pleased to announce that we will be running two one-day workshops
  on how to teach programming
  during the PyCon sprints in Montreal on April 14 and 15, 2014.
  The workshops will be led by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#wilson.g">Greg Wilson</a>,
  who will show participants how to use basic concepts from educational psychology and instructional design
  when teaching beginners how to code.
  The event is open to everyone,
  not just to PyCon attendees;
