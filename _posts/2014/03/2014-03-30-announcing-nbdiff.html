<p>
  I am very pleased to announce the first release of NBDiff,
  a tool for diffing and merging IPython Notebooks
  that is now available on
  <a href="https://github.com/tarmstrong/nbdiff">GitHub</a>
  and 
  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nbdiff">PyPI</a>.
  NBDiff was created by a team of students at
  <a href="http://www.concordia.ca/">Concordia University</a> in Montr&eacute;al;
  our thanks and congratulations to Shurouq Abusalah,
  Tavish Armstrong,
  Marwa Malti,
