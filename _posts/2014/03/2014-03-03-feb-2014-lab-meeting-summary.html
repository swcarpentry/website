  We held a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/lab-meeting-feb-2014.html">lab meeting</a> last week.
  48 people attended in two sessions (to accommodate different time zones);
  the main points are summarized below.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Community</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>We asked participants how many other people in the meeting they knew.  The median answer was somewhere around 2, which is a sign that our social graph isn't as densely connected as it could be (or in non-hipster terms, we mostly don't know each other very well).</li>
      <li>We're going to address this by running a two-day work sprint in July or August.  People will be invited to come to the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/">Mozilla office</a> near them, or to congregate in other spaces, and we'll connect those meetups via telepresence.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Communications</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Several people have said that they find it hard to keep track of upcoming bootcamps&mdash;in particular, that they sometimes hear about a bootcamp they could have volunteered at only after it's over.</li>
      <li>We will start including a list of all upcoming bootcamps in the weekly summaries of Software Carpentry activity on the <a href="http://mozillascience.org/blog/">Mozilla Science Lab blog</a> and on our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/">own blog</a> as well.</li>
      <li>We also recommend using <code>#swcSITE</code> as a Twitter hashtag during bootcamps (e.g., <code>#swcUBC</code>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Operations</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>We'll try to be more consistent using (and updating) the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/">operations guide</a>.</li>
      <li>And Greg will start covering it in instructor training.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Lesson Content</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Our novice lessons are coming together well: they have been merged into the <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/tree/gh-pages">gh-pages branch of the bootcamp repository on GitHub</a> and are now <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/lessons/">on the web site</a>.</li>
      <li>We still need to assemble our novice R materials; <a href="mailto:jdblischakATuchicagoDOTedu">John Blischak has</a> volunteered to coordinate, so please contact him if you'd like to help.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Building Lessons</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>We are trying to streamline the tools and processes used to compile our lessons: see <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/349">this issue</a> on GitHub for details, and to join the conversation.</li>
      <li>One reason to work on this is that we want to partner with other people interested in teaching computing skills to researchers: there will be a blog post about this soon.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Teaching</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>We are collecting teaching notes in the <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/tree/master/novice/teaching"><code>novice/teaching</code> directory</a> in the bootcamp repository.</li>
      <li>Greg will merge in <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/56">existing tips and tricks</a>.</li>
      <li>These files will be our collective wisdom: please send pull requests (or <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">mail us</a>) with tips, tricks, and corrections.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Code Review</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/01/code-review-round-2.html">second round of our study of scientific code review</a> has started: 11 mentors have been matched with groups of scientists, and are setting up their first meetings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>PyCon 2014</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>We still have lots of spaces in our <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pycon-montreal-software-carpentry-bootcamp-registration-10151376039">bootcamp on April 14-15 in Montreal</a>&mdash;please help get the word out to your friends and colleagues.</li>
      <li>We will be taking Software Carpentry folks out for dinner during the conference: stay tuned for details.</li>
      <li>And we'll be at SciPy in Austin in July: again, please stay tuned for details.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Instructor Training</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The online round starting late April 2014 is full, but there are still spaces for the one starting in June 2014: please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">mail us</a> if you'd like to take part.</li>
      <li>There are still spaces for the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/software-carpentry-instructor-training-registration-9481333925">live version</a> April 28-30 in Toronto.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Miscellaneous Tasks</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Comments on <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/pull/341">this script</a> that checks a bootcamp's <code>index.html</code> <em>before</em> it is committed would be welcome.</li>
      <li>We would like <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/350">a script to set up a bootcamp repository</a> with the right permissions and content: see <a href="https://vimeo.com/87241285">this video</a> for what we do now.</li>
      <li>We would like to make <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/301">HTML5 video</a> available for lessons as well as Flash.</li>
      <li><a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/336">Links in the HTML pages generated from notebooks to the notebooks themselves</a> would be handy.</li>
      <li>So would <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/214">previous/next links</a> between the new lessons.</li>
      <li>Would someone like to write <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/210">a short tutorial about extracting data from Excel spreadsheets</a>?</li>
      <li>It would be handy if we could display <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/302">multiple Eventbrite widgets</a> on a single bootcamp page.</li>
      <li>It would also be handy if we could include <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/11">complex schedules</a> in bootcamp pages and our calendar.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Q&amp;A</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>How are donations going?</em>
	<ul>
	  <li>A few people have reported that finding money is a struggle bureaucratically, but that's true for instructor travel costs as well.  (We still have to handle each case individually: every university, funding agency, and country has its own rules...)</li>
	  <li>We're working with our Mozilla colleagues to make the process clearer and appreciate your patience and input. If you have suggestions, please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact us</a> directly.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Does Software Carpentry take donations from individuals?</em>
	<ul>
	  <li>The Mozilla Foundation certainly does; we're working on ways to tag the money for specific purposes (but again, there are legal constraints because of our non-profit status).</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Students often want (some of) the code before hand, what is our policy on that?</em>
	<ul>
	  <li>Absolutely: this is why we have nicely formatted HTML pages for the V5 content now.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>What about certification for learners?</em>
	<ul>
	  <li>We get asked for this from time to time, especially by European graduate students who want to count the hours toward degree requirements.</li>
	  <li>We want something more meaningful than a certificate of attendance, but don't know how to assess learning.</li>
	  <li>The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2013/11/dirac-edinburgh.html">DiRAC driver's license</a> is going well, but is time-consuming.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Can Software Carpentry help me find a software related job?</em>
	<ul>
	  <li>Greg would be very happy to help anyone who's given time to Software Carpentry in any way he can: please just ask.</li>
	</ul>
