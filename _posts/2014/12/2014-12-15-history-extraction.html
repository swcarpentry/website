  As discussed <a href="plans-for-2015-lessons.html">previously</a>,
  we are currently extracting individual lessons from the
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc"><code>bc</code></a>
  repository to make them more modular, which will ease use,
  contribution, and maintenance.  This post presents some guidelines
  for extracting individual lessons and how to contribute to lessons
  in the meantime.
</p>

<p>
  Individual lessons are currently in folders in
  the <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc"><code>bc</code></a>
  repository, e.g. <code>novice/python</code>. The aim of history
  extraction is to take the content and history of an individual
  lesson and move it to a new repository specifically for that lesson.
  We want to preserve history in order to recognise past
  contributions: just copying and pasting the files would lose this.
</p>
<p>
  Using the novice Python lesson as an example:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      One person takes ownership of the history extraction for a
      specific lesson and creates an issue
      in <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc">the <code>bc</code>
      repository</a> with the labels <code>Extract History</code>,
      <code>novice</code>, <code>Python</code> and a title like
      "Extract history of novice Python lesson".  Progress regarding
      the history extraction is then tracked in that issue
      (<a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/877">example</a>).
      An overview of all of the current extractions can be seen using
      the <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/labels/Extract%20History">Extract
      History</a> label.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      That person creates a personal repository,
      e.g. <a href="https://github.com/aaren/swc-novice-python">aaren/swc-novice-python</a>
      where the history extraction takes place.  The exact process
      used for extracting the history varies a little by
      lesson. Inspiration can be found in the
      <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/labels/Extract%20History">Extract
      History issues</a>, for example
      the <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/877">novice
      python issue</a> or
      the <a href="https://github.com/wking/swc-modular-shell/issues/3">shell
      extraction</a>.  Briefly, that person needs to use <code>git
      filter-branch</code> to extract the history of the lesson,
      paying attention to path changes if the file was ever moved from
      one place to another, and extract the history of the cheat sheet
      stored in the <code>novice/ref</code> directory.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      At this point the <code>novice/python</code> lesson
      in <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc">bc</a> is
      frozen. All new issues and Pull Requests should be made against
      the new repository (linked in the issue).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When the history extraction is completed, the new issues and
      pull-requests can be reviewed. When all are dealt with, the
      lesson is frozen again and transitioned to fit the
      new <a href="{{site.github_url}}/lesson-template">lesson
      template</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Following the transition to the lesson template, the lesson is
      live and is in a permanent new home.  That will probably be under the
      <a href="{{site.github_url}}">{{site.github_url}}</a>
      account for our core lessons, but could well be under someone
      else's account, for the same reason that people can host
      workshop websites under their own accounts if they choose: to
      support truly open collaboration.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
