<p>
  For the last three years,
  I've been storing information about instructors, workshops, and other things
  in a small SQLite database
  so that I can look things up and generate statistics when I need to.
  I can't publish it,
  since it contains personal identifying information,
  but since I had to write a script to migrate the data to
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/amy">the tool we're building to manage workshops</a>,
  it only took another few minutes to create a partly-redacted version of the data.
  ("Partly" because someone who was really keen could work backward workshop URLs to instructors' names,
  cross-reference,
  and recover the names of some fraction of our instructors.
  Since that information is all public anyway,
  though,
  I don't think I've introduced any new risks.)
</p>
<p>
  The SQL source for the database is <a href="{{ site.filesurl }}/2014/12/swc-db-2014-12-14.sql">here</a>;
  with it,
  you can regenerate the database using:
</p>
<!--more-->
<pre>
$ sqlite3 swc.db < swc-db-2014-12-14.sql
</pre>
<p>
  You can then ask lots of questions&mdash;some examples are included below.
  If you'd like a little end-of-year procrastination,
  what else can you find in this data that's interesting?
