<p>
  Just a reminder that
  our last online lab meeting for 2014 will be held at
  10:00 am Eastern time on Thursday, December 4,
  and will be repeated at 7:00 pm Eastern on the same day.
  We will be making several big announcements,
  so if you're planning to attend,
  please add yourself to the Etherpad at
  <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-labmeeting-2014-11">https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-labmeeting-2014-11</a>
  so that we have an idea of numbers.
  We look forward to seeing you Thursday.
</p>
