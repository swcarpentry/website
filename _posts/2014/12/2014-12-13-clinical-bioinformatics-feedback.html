<p>Early in November we put on Software Carpentry for the students of the MSc course
in Clinical Bioinformatics run by the University of Manchester, UK
and the British National Health Service (NHS). The course combines  academic curriculum
with work-based programme. The students (who already are qualified professionals)
are based at various clinical units in the UK and meet only a few times to attend
short intense training sessions. The instructors at the Software Carpentry
workshop were Aleksandra Nenadic, who taught for the first time, and myself;
we were helped by Mike Cornell and Andy Brass.</p>

<p>After a few discussions with the course leader, professor Andy
Brass, we decided to embed the regular Software Carpentry workshop in
a week-long training aiming to teach the students best practices in
programming but also give them a higher level overview to help them in
their future career when they may be co-leading development of
safety-critical software. Hence, the Software Carpentry bit included
the module on unit testing to show the participants the approaches to
testing software beyond regression testing which they might have
already been familiar with. We also added a very short introduction to
handling XML files with Python using ElementTree library.  This module
was added just for the purposes of this particular course. After
completing the Software Carpentry part, the students were given an
assignment to write a simple parser for XML files used in
bioinformatics. The students were divided into groups of 4 and in
completing the task were using the tools and methods which Software
Carpentry covered. The assessment criteria were largely based on
whether the students wrote modularised and well structured code,
documented and tested it. The use of version control was another
criterion. The Software Carpentry instructors were not involved in the
assessment but professor Andy Brass told us that the students' results
were outstanding.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that the group consisted of only 12 students, which
obviously made the teaching much easier than during regular workshops which
on aaverage are attended by 30 students. As usually, their skills varied and
some of them were more advanced than others. However, on the workshop
website we linked more material which allowed the advanced students to work
further in their own pace whilst we focused on teaching those who were less
familiar with the given topic.</p>

<p>In my experience, teaching at Software Carpentry workshops is always a
enjoyable experience as the attendees really want to learn the skills which
should help them with their everyday work. At this particular course, the
students were exceptionally highly motivated and were very keen to work
throughout the material. Several of them signed up for the Data Carpentry
workshop which we run two weeks later also in Manchester.  I found this very
rewarding as an instructor.</p>
<p>In fact, Andy Brass, who collected feedback from the students,
said, "Students were hugely appreciative of the SW carpentry
course. It was interesting to sit in at the back and watch just how
engaged the students were with the process (...). They were almost
annoyed with us that something so useful to them had not been made
available earlier to them". We are therefore now working towards making
Software and Data Carpentry training accessible more regularly to the
NHS training students.</p>
