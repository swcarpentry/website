  Thanks to the work of
  <a href="https://github.com/abought">Andy Boughton</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/r-gaia-cs">Raniere Silva</a>,
  we now have a validator that determines whether lessons fit 
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/lesson-template/">the new lesson template</a>.
  This post explains what it does,
  where there is room for improvement,
  and how you can help.
</p>

<h2>Current State</h2>
<p>
  The validator uses
  Python's <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/CommonMark">CommonMark parser</a>
  to create an
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">abstract syntax tree</a>
  from a Markdown file.
  This allows our code to focus on validating templates,
  rather than re-implementing a parser that can handle variations in Markdown.
</p>
<p>
  Because each template has slightly different needs,
  the validator is implemented using an object-oriented approach
  that allows individual tests to be customized or re-used as needed.
  Each template validator class is a child of <code>MarkdownValidator</code>,
  so to understand how the validator works for <code>pages/LICENSE.md</code>,
  you just need to look at the special methods in <code>LicensePageValidator</code>,
  and whatever code is inherited or used from the parent class <code>MarkdownValidator</code>.
</p>
<h2>What Validation is Performed</h2>
<p>
  The validator currently performs the following checks on all templates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    All expected YAML document headers must be present
    and contain the correct type of data
    (e.g. the argument for <code>minutes</code> must be numeric).
  </li>
  <li>
    All headings required by the template must be present, and in the correct order.
  </li>
  <li>
    All document headings must be level 2 (i.e. <code>## Heading</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    If the template is not free-form, then only the headings specified should be present.
  </li>
  <li>
    Links to external assets (html pages or images) must be valid.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Additional checks are performed on certain templates as needed:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Special blocks (such as Prerequisites and Learning Objectives)
    must have the correct structure and contents.
  </li>
  <li>
    The glossary in <code>pages/reference.md</code> must be formatted correctly.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>pages/LICENSE.md</code> file must not be changed.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>How You Can Help</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Summarize the changes to the specifications (see below).
  </li>
  <li>
    Test the validator on a folder full of markdown files from the command line:
    <code>$ tools/check pages/</code>.
    Let us know if the validator is too restrictive for your lessons,
    or if it misses a common problem.
  </li>
  <li>
    Report suggestions and bugs
    <a href="{{site.github_url}}/lesson-template/issues">on GitHub</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Send pull requests to improve the code.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson Template Specification</h2>
<p>
  Several of the core Software Carpentry lessons
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2014/12/plans-for-2015-lessons.html">have recently been ported</a>
  to the new template.
  As we apply the template to lessons,
  the original template specification has continued to evolve&mdash;see
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/lesson-template">the lesson template's repository</a>
  for the latest description.
  The validator reflects these changes.
</p>
<p>
  For example,
  authors no longer need to specify CSS styles in topic files,
  so we can write:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; ## Learning Objectives
&gt;
&gt; * Learning objective 1
&gt; * Learning objective 2
</pre>
<p>
  instead of:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; ## Learning Objectives {.objectives}
&gt;
&gt; * Learning objective 1
&gt; * Learning objective 2
</pre>
