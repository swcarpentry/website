  The 2015 <a href="http://www.se4science.org/workshops/se4hpcs15/">International Workshop on Software Engineering for High Performance Computing in Science</a>
  is being held in conjunction with
  the <a href="http://2015.icse-conferences.org/">International Conference on Software Engineering</a>
  in Florence, Italy in May 2015.
  Topics to be covered include:
</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
  <li>the demanding characteristics of research software that affect its development choices;</li>
  <li>the appropriate context dimensions to describe research software;</li>
  <li>the major software quality goals for research software to run on HPC architectures;</li>
  <li>crossing the communication chasm between SE and Science when experiments are software or data-intensive;</li>
  <li>effectively involving scientists in software development and training;</li>
  <li>measuring the impact of SE on scientific productivity;</li>
  <li>SE tools and methods needed by the scientific community; and</li>
  <li>how to effectively test scientific HPC software.</li>
</ul>
