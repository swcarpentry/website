  The Department of Nuclear Engineering at the University of
  California, Berkeley is searching for one, possibly two high-caliber
  researchers to work with Prof. Rachel Slaybaugh's group in the area
  of computational neutronics. Fields of highest relevance are
  Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, and Nuclear Engineering.
</p>
<p>
  Prof. Slaybaugh's group researches methods and algorithms for
  solving the Boltzmann transport equation more effectively. These
  methods are often inspired by the physics of the problem at hand,
  developments in computer hardware, or both. Ongoing work involves
  deterministic solution methods, Monte Carlo methods, and hybrid
  methods in which deterministic solutions are used to accelerate
  Monte Carlo solutions. Potential Projects include Angle-informed
  Hybrid Methods, Deterministic "Plug-and-Play" Research Environment
  Creation, Improving Multigroup Cross Sections for Hybrid Methods and
  Monte Carlo on Graphical Processing Units
</p>
<p>
  We seek a candidate who can start this position as early as January
  2015 but the appointment start date is flexible. The initial
  appointment is 100% time for one year, with the possibility of
  renewal for a second year, dependent upon job performance and
  funding. Starting salaries are in the range of $50,000 to $60,000
  per year and commensurate with qualifications and experience.
