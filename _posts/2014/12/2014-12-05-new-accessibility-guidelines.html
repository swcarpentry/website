  Software Carpentry values the participation of every member of the
  scientific community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and
  fulfilling experience.
  Thanks to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#barmby.pauline">Pauline Barmby</a>,
  we now have
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/checklists/accessibility/">an accessibility checklist</a>
  for instructors and workshop hosts.
  Please have a look
  and send us fixes and suggestions for improvements.
