<p>The University College London Research Software Development Initiative is seeking a full-stack web developer to work on its Research Software Dashboard project from January 2015 to July 2015.</p>
<p>This is a new project, starting from scratch, to develop software to curate, promote, and manage the University's wide portfolio of cutting-edge scientific and scholarly software.</p>
<p>The project will provide an overview of the research software output of the college for scientists, managers, funders, investors and clients, including both open-source software and software being commercialised through the university's business and consulting arms. It will integrate with the University's code management infrastructure, based on GitHub Enterprise, software testing infrastructure based on Jenkins, and commercial software sales platform e-Lucid.</p>
<p>Software is an increasingly important scholarly output for research alongside publications, and this project will help retain UCL's leadership in this important aspect of twenty-first century research.</p>
<p>Those interested in being involved in this important project on a freelance or contractor basis should get in touch with James Hetherington (j.hetherington@ucl.ac.uk) for more information.  For more information, please see <a href="http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/research-software-development/recruit-dashboard/">the full description</a>.</p>
