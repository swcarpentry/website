  As we said in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/12/scf-governance.html">previous post</a> in this series,
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/announcing-the-creation-of-the-software-carpentry-foundational.html">our interim Steering Committee</a>
  has adopted bylaws for the Software Carpentry Foundation.
  They have also agreed on four tiers of membership
  so that universities, companies, government labs, and other entities
  can help support and guide our work.
  The authoritative version is stored in
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/board">this public GitHub repository</a>,
  but in brief,
  the tiers are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <em>Partners</em>,
    who make a significant long-term contribution to organizing and delivering workshops;
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Affiliates</em>,
    who are organizing workshops and helping with admin, but not at the same level;
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Sponsors</em>,
    who underwrite the cost of particular workshops that would otherwise not have backers;
    and
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Donors</em>,
    who simply wish to make cash or in-kind contributions to help with general operations.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each membership tier is described below.
  The Steering Committee and Advisory Council will revisit them in a year's time
  to ensure they're meeting everyone's needs,
  and we will always be willing to discuss other arrangements.
  Please mail <a href="mailto:{{site.board_inquiries}}">{{site.board_inquiries}}</a>
  if you would like more information,
  or would like to start a discussion about how you could help.
  And of course,
  individual donations to the cause will always be welcome:

<h2>Organizational Membership</h2>
<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>An <em>internal</em> workshop is one whose audience is mainly from the host organization (e.g., a workshop run by the University of Melbourne for staff and students of the University of Melbourne).</p></li>
<li><p>An <em>external</em> workshop is one whose audience is mainly for people not at or from the host organization (e.g., a workshop organized by the University of Melbourne but run at the University of Wollongong).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Coordinating</em> a workshop means handling the administration involved in lining up instructors, administering assessment questionnaires, providing information on attendees to the SCF, etc. Staff working for the organizer do not necessarily teach the workshop.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hosting</em> a workshop means providing space for it, supporting travel costs for instructors (if applicable), etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>administration fee</em> is the fee the SCF charges per workshop to support curriculum development, instructor training, and central administrative costs. The amount is specified in the current version of the workshop guidelines.</p></li>
</ul>
