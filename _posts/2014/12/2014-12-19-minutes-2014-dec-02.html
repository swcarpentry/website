<li>The Steering Committee agrees to hold elections in the week of Jan 26-30
  <ul>
    <li>To be announced at Dec 4 lab meeting.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>That the Software Carpentry Foundation pay the Executive Director a bonus in 2015 at least commensurate with his unpaid time in Nov/Dec 2014 once there is a three-month operating reserve.</li>
<li>That the next round of online instructor training be delayed until February so that the Executive Director can concentrate on fundraising and other organizational matters in January.</li>
</ul>
<p>Discussion</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine status of GW's salary</li>
<li>Will GW receive back pay for December (and November?) if and when funds become available?</li>
<li>Proposal: We start paying GW a salary in January (when we have money coming in) with the intention of paying him a &quot;bonus&quot; at least commensurate with his unpaid time contribution (after he left Mozilla through the beginning of his SCF funding as ED) once our financial reserves have reached an acceptable level (3 months operating reserves + amount for bonus). Based on this offer, GW can decide whether he would be prepared to continue working in December.</li>
<li>The members of Steering Committee do not think that there has been enough money received/expected to be received to enable salary for December.</li>
<li>Roles and responsibilities for Steering Committee (SC) members:
  <ul>
    <li>KH has created a draft</li>
    <li>Still lots of questions:
      <ul>
	<li>Should there be a requirement that the Steering Committee (SC) have subcommittees on which SC members are required to serve? (e.g., each SC member must serve on at least one subcommittee, such as the financial subcommittee)?</li>
	<li>How much volunteer time should we require in addition to the meetings? (currently 2 hours per week)</li>
	<li>We drafted some responsibilities for the chair, so that wasn't added to this document.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Discuss setting up a finance sub-group of the SC.</li>
<li>Deferred: purchasing software licenses for Executive Director.</li>
</ul>
