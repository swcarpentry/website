  Helped by Aaron O'Leary, Peter Willetts, Marlene 
  Mengoni and Jo Leng, Martin Callaghan, Devasena Inupakutika 
  and I recently delivered a modified Software Carpentry 
  workshop at the University of Leeds. Aimed at environmental 
  scientists from across the UK and funded by NERC, the course 
  included an extra day where small groups got to develop tools 
  for environmental data analysis.

<h2>Training for Graduate Students</h2>
<p>
  The funding landscape for graduate students in science in 
  the UK has changed. Most of our gaggle of <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/">research councils</a> now 
  provide funding to universities to train coherent groups 
  of PhD students. These students can be working on related 
  research projects in an area where a particular national 
  training need has been identified (creating doctoral training 
  centres such as the <a href="http://www.maths.leeds.ac.uk/postgraduate-research/how-to-apply/project-opportunities/fluid-dynamics-dtc.html">DTC in fluid dynamics</a> in Leeds) or undertaking a 
  broader range of projects where supervision and generic 
  training is provided by a consortium of university departments 
  working with other organisations in the private and public 
  sectors (forming doctoral training partnerships such as the 
  <a href="http://www.nercdtp.leeds.ac.uk/">Leeds-York DTP</a>).
</p>
<p>
  Although a late starter in this process, the Natural Environment 
  Research Council (<a href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk/">NERC</a>) has embraced the approach 
  and now funds most of its doctoral training via these two routes. 
  NERC now pays closer attention to the training needs of graduate 
  students in the environmental sciences, for example by asking 
  employers about <a href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk/skills/postgrad/policy/skillsreview/">skill gaps</a> and encouraging 
  universities to fill these. 
</p>
<p>
  The usual way for research councils to encourage universities 
  to do anything is by providing an opportunity for academics to 
  compete for funding. NERC's <a href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk/funding/available/postgrad/advanced/atsc/">Advanced Training Short Course</a> scheme offers funding 
  specifically to address identified skills gaps. These include 
  "scientific computing in environmental sciences" and 
  "data processing in environmental sciences", so 
  Software Carpentry is clearly needed for the UK's environmental 
  scientists. In May this year and working with Neil Chue Hong 
  at the <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">Software Sustainability Institute</a> we applied for for 
  funding under this scheme. The application is <a 
  href="http://figshare.com/articles/ATSC_application_to_NERC/1206320">available online</a> but, in essence, we asked for funding 
  to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create modified Software Carpentry lessons targeted at 
    NERC students and including additional material on, for 
    example, handling geospatial data and accessing such data 
    from online repositories.</li>
  <li>Run two three-day workshops based on the Software Carpentry 
    model to deliver this material to NERC students from around 
    the UK. The third day of these workshops was added to allow 
    small groups of students to work together to practice their 
    skills and begin to develop software that may be useful for 
    their research projects. </li>
  <li>Offer the modifications back to Software Carpentry, so 
    that they could be used again to train further environmental 
    scientists in the UK and elsewhere.</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  We have now delivered the <a href="http://andreww.github.io/2014-11-24-leeds/">first of these workshops</a> and describe some of the successes 
  and difficulties below.
</p>
<h2>Software Difficulties</h2>
<p>
  As is traditional (and probably inevitable) we discovered a 
  handful challenges with software installation on diverse laptops 
  <a 
  href="{{site.baseurl}}/faq/#bring-what-to-workshop">brought to the workshop</a>. Despite these by 9:30 
  day 1 everybody had a working installation.
</p>
<p>
  The most notable new problem was a Windows machine where the 
  username contained a non-ascii character. This almost works 
  out of the box. However, accents in the directory name for 
  the homespace propagate into python strings used to to find 
  configuration files (e.g. when matplotlib is imported, or an 
  iPython notebook server is started). This problem will probably 
  go away when we move to python 3, but in the interim the best 
  solution we found was to create a new user account (without 
  accents in the username) and install everything there. It 
  would be good to know if a better solution to this exists.
</p>
<p>
  A second problem with software cropped up unexpectedly over 
  lunch on the first day. Our <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/SWC-Leeds-NERC-Nov2014">etherpad</a>,
  which was being 
  used for collaborative note taking and to ease the distribution 
  of long strings (URLs and the like) failed, getting itself into 
  a state of permanently "loading...". Marlene eventually 
  managed to cajole the old information (in somewhat corrupted 
  form) out of the ether and we moved over to an alternative 
  <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/UtREnyD7KE">pad</a>. 
  The lesson for other workshops may be to 
  download text copies of the etherpad fairly frequently to 
  allow a quick recovery.
</p>
<p>
  The third noteable little challenge only emerged when we 
  started looking at environmental data stored in netCDF files. 
  For two people data could not be read despite having the 
  netcdf4 module installed and successfully imported. This 
  turned out to be a problem with the underlying library installed 
  by Anaconda on 32 bit Ubuntu systems. The solution (discovered 
  by Aaron) is to install an alternative version using:
</p>
<pre>
 $ conda remove netcdf4
 $ sudo apt-get build-dep python-netcdf4
 $ sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev
 $ pip install netcdf4
</pre>
<h2>Programming Success?</h2>
<p>
  Most of day three (apart from a short recap in the 
  morning and wrap up and feedback session at the end 
  of the day) was taken up by a mini data analysis 
  hackathon where small groups worked to create software 
  to solve problems conceived by the participants. This 
  seemed to be remarkably successful with each group 
  producing a working tool written in python that had 
  been developed collaboratively using Git and with at 
  least some documentation and error handling. We ended 
  up with:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A tool to download and map historic earthquake data 
    for a region from the USGS data service (<a 
						href="https://github.com/georgetaylor3152/SAFIRE">GitHub</a>).
  </li>
  <li>A flight miles calculator that converts airport codes 
    to locations, calculates the great circle distance between 
    the airports, and plots this on a map (<a href="https://github.com/callaghanmt/phd-flight-tracker.git">GitHub</a>).
  </li>
  <li>An iPython notebook that scrapes a website to determine when 
    a particular satellite will next be overhead
    (<a href="https://github.com/SophMC/satellite_tracking">GitHub</a>).
  </li>
  <li>Some fairly complex object oriented code to fit a range of 
    equations of state to pressure - volume data for Earth materials
    (<a href="https://github.com/gracecox/EoSeval">GitHub</a>).
  </li>
  <li>An iPython notebook to examine the geographical distribution 
    of the genetics of bacteria using an online database (<a href="https://github.com/CyanoEvo/global_G-C_map">GitHub</a>).
  </li>
  <li>A data gridder for shallow geophysical surveys allowing 
    scattered data sets to be imported into ArcGIS (<a href="https://github.com/skiingfox/Group_Project">GitHub</a>).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All the groups managed to demonstrate and talk about their project 
  in a wrap up session at the end of the day. I was amazed. Not only 
  were twenty PhD students exposed to a new programming language, 
  their first version control system, and concepts such as 
  defensive programming and testing in only two days. They were able 
  to demonstrate that they had learned to use their new skills by 
  undertaking collaborative programming project dealing with real 
  data from the environmental sciences and get something working in 
  only five hours.
</p>
<h2>Going Forward</h2>
<p>
  We will be giving the course again in January and we collected 
  feedback during and after the workshop to help us improve for 
  the next iteration. The biggest trends in feedback across the 
  course were "Git is hard" and "the IPython 
  notebook is great". More detailed feedback from the end 
  of the workshop included:
</p>
<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Good points</th>
    <th>Places to improve</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the helpers</td>
    <td>needed a general overview for Git, also pictures</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>practical session on day three</td>
    <td>lost track of defensive programming</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Git was taught and then used it in practice the next day</td>
    <td>sometimes hard to read text (colours of text difficult)</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>

      automating a process using a pipeline</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>good number of people. excellent ratio of 
      helpers / students</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>good to rotate people between tables each day</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  Overall, I think we probably spent a little too much time on 
  basic shell at the start of day 1 (which most people had seen 
  before) and should have planned to spend more time with Git 
  (perhaps breaking the single two hour slot into two lessons, 
  each with their own exercises). We will try to improve next 
  time, but need to remember that the previous experience of 
  the next group could be significantly different. We should also
  make sure that when we teach using the terminal, the text is 
  large and clear (what is clear on a projector is different to
  what is clear on laptop display) and make more reference to 
  some of the useful online help for git. For example, we did not
  show
  <a href="https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf">this</a>
or make very much reference to the <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">online tutorial</a>.
</p>
<p>
  NERC have just announced details of next year's ATSC 
  scheme. Scientific computing is still on the list of key 
  skills to be provided and we are starting to discuss a new 
  application for funding. A major objective must be to attempt 
  to embed this kind of training into the training experienced by of 
  most of NERC's PhD students. Key to this would be to 
  work with several of the institutions that host large doctoral 
  training partnerships and seek to leave sufficient instructors 
  and helpers in NERC's research community so that the DTPs 
  will run their own training in the future. This may imply that we
  need to find and train more instructors.
</p>
<p>
  We are looking forward to our <a href="http://andreww.github.io/2015-01-14-leeds/">second workshop</a>
  in 
  January. We will report on the modified material once we have given 
  it another go, when we will need to work out the best way to make 
  this widely available.
