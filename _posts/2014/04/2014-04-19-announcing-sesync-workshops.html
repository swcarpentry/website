  Applications are now open for the 2014 Computational Summer Institute
  at the National Socio-Environment Synthesis Center (SESYNC).
  Small teams of researchers are invited to apply for spaces at the one-week institute
  which will be held July 7-11 in Annapolis, Maryland.
  The workshop will offer participants hands-on training in managing the lifecycle of their data and code
  with a focus on using open source tools, including R.
  Topics will include

<!--more-->
<ul>
  <li>best practices and techniques for collaborative code development;</li>
  <li>developing and testing code for data management, modeling, and analysis; and</li>
  <li>visualizing and disseminating results.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The beginning of the week will cover material in a typical Software Carpentry workshop.
  During the middle portion of the workshop,
  breakout sessions will convene to discuss additional tools of interest based on applicant responses.
  Participants will apply what they've learned to their own data and research problems
  in consultation with workshop instructors during the last two days of the workshop.

  SESYNC will cover eligible travel expenses,
  such as airfare and accommodations,
  for all participants.
