The <a href="https://luispedro.github.io/2014-04-03-sdu/" title="Software
Carpentry Workshop at University of Southern Denmark">workshop at University of
Southern Denmark, Odense</a> was my first workshop for Software Carpentry, the
same is true for <a href="http://luispedro.org/" title="Luis Pedro Coelho"
hreflang="en">Luis</a> as well. We had taught before, Luis more than me, but it
was still exciting for me to see how this workshop would go given that we never
taught together before. While I taught <strong>bash</strong>, <strong>regular
expressions</strong> and <strong>Git</strong>, Luis taught
<strong>Python</strong>, <strong>unit testing</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>.
Initially, make was also on that list, but due to time constraints was kicked
out to make room for a second Git lecture.

Around 30 persons attended the course, mostly from SDU and
the <a href="http://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/institutter_centre/maxo">Max-Planck
Odense Center (MaxO)</a>. All in all, the workshop was well-received
and the attendees as well as the instructors were highly
motivated. But there is still lots of room for improvement:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>shell lecture</strong> was way <strong>too slow</strong>, so
  that I could not do any of the demos. This was bad for a couple of reasons,
  but mainly because people did not know about even the most basic things which
  were needed for the Git part.</li>
  <li>The regular expressions lecture should also increase in speed. Also, we (=
  SWC instructors) must be aware that <strong>Apple ships old BSD
  versions</strong> of the commonly used command line tools. These <strong>lack
  essential features</strong>, so that grep output cannot be colored on OS
  X!</li>
  <li>Git just cannot be taught in 1.5 h to people without any prior knowledge of
  version control, at least not in a comprehensible way. Git is so incredibly
  powerful and the concepts behind it are so intricate that it is easy to
  cognitively overload people. Therefore, I dropped the make lecture and did a
  &rsquo;<strong>Git Double Feature</strong>&lsquo; instead. Also, I noticed
  that I am suffering from <strong>expert's blind spot</strong>: when asked
  about where one can see the files of different branches on the computer, I
  realized that this feature of Git was so obvious to me that I did not explain
  that at all.</li>
  <li>Probably the most interesting/realistic way to show Git is to have a new
  repository created before the workshop. That repository already contains some
  linear commits with simple scripts. People will clone it during the workshop
  and do some work in a new branch. While they are doing that new commits are
  added to the master branch, which people should fetch/pull and see the
  effect.</li>
  <li><strong>Showroom</strong>: Now and then we need to be able to show people
  what great things they can do with tools we teach. This would serve two
  purposes:
    <ul>
      <li>People would see right away the usefulness of what we are teaching.
      This should boost motivation.</li>
      <li>People have a moment to relax.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The workshop was held on a Thursday and Friday and it was obvious that people,
especially after lunch break on Friday, were mentally quite exhausted already.
At that time I noticed just how much information (as measured in the
&rsquo;unit&lsquo; mind map connections) we conveyed during the two days. And
that is what the &rsquo;showroom&lsquo; is thought to be for.

Big thanks go to Owen Jones from SDU for organizing, things really worked out
great.
