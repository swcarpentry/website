<p>The second week of April the University of Warwick in the UK hosted its first 
Software Carpentry bootcamp. The bootcamp was organised by 
<a href="http://www.garnetcommunity.org.uk/">GARNet</a> which is a UK-based 
research network for the UK Arabidopsis and wider plant research community. 
GARNet facilitates collaboration and interaction between different researchers 
and supports skills development.</p>

<p>The bootcamp was open to all researchers from the domain and many out of 
32 participants came from outside of Warwick.  However, the longest journey prize goes to
Christina Koch who came from Vancouver to co-instruct with 
Aleksandra Pawlik from the Software Sustainability Institute.</p>

<p>The two main organisers, <a href="http://www.garnetcommunity.org.uk/advisers/charis-cook">
Charis Cook</a> and <a href="http://www.garnetcommunity.org.uk/advisers/lisa-martin-0">
Lisa Martin</a> did an amazing job making sure everything was in place for the bootcamp. 
Not only did the attendees receive a booklet with all essential information about the event, 
everyone had a chance to discuss and network at the end of Day 1 during the dinner 
which Charis and Lisa organised on the campus.  The icing on the cake (almost literally)?  
The dinner was topped up with some 
fancy <a href="https://twitter.com/aleksandrana/status/453950126017769472/photo/1">dessert</a>.</p>

<p>The three helpers Leonor Garcia-Gutierrez, Krzysztof Polanski and Jason Piper 
helped make sure that things run smoothly. The participants were working either 
on Windows machines or Macs (with a slight prevalence of the latter). Some 
machines were problematic when it comes to the setup.  Eventually, thanks to 
the helpers everyone had all necessary software up and running.</p>

<p>The pre-bootcamp questionnaire showed that around a half of 
the participants had no or very little experience with programming. Several 
had not used the command line before. For that reason, the module on using 
command line started with the explaining the basics of the environment and
 the simple commands. At the end of this session Christina taught
 how to write and run shell scripts. Showing the power of the shell
 to the attendees was very convincing. The only problem we encountered 
was the fact that the "chmod" command is not supported on GitBash 
which many of the attendees were using. </p>

<p>The next module, version control, was a new topic for almost all attendees.  
The module started at the right pace for everyone 
to follow, discussing Git workflow on a local machine.  However, 
when we moved to working with remote repositories on GitHub, it
 became a bit too rushed. Git is not an easy start with version 
control for beginners and maybe this particular module should be
 extended at bootcamp where most of the audience is new to the topic.</p>

<p>Introduction to programming with Python was taught using the 
IPython Notebooks which everyone seemed to like.  The only 
misunderstanding that emerged from using IPythong Notebooks was that 
some attendees were convinced we worked online (since the Notebooks
 open in a browser).  Once the confusion was laid to rest, attendees 
 were keen to learn more, especially once they realized they could use
 this tool anywhere, sans wifi.  </p>

<p>Day 2 of the bootcamp covered more programming with Python 
and an introduction to the Pandas library. Using the latter we
 showed the participants how to easily manipulate large *.csv files 
which they are likely to use in their everyday research. 
The teaching finished with Christina discussing debugging 
and testing. </p>

<p>At the end of the bootcamp, participants were given a final exercise 
in which they had to fork a repository with an unfinished
 piece of Python code (which also included a small bug). The point 
of the exercise was to give the attendees an opportunity to see how
 the skills they learnt separately over the course of two days
 could be combined in one task.  There was also time for attendees with 
 specific questions to consult with the instructors and helpers 
 about how to implement skills from the past two days into their work. </p>
