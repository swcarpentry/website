  I didn't have nearly enough time to enjoy everything that was going on
  at <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/">PyCon 2014</a> last week.
  One event I particularly regret missing was a sprint
  organized in part by the folks at <a href="http://scrapinghub.com/">Scrapinghub</a>.
  They got a bunch of people to write little scrapers to go through old conference websites,
  pull out speakers' names,
  and run them through a gender identification library
  in order to plot changes in gender balance per conference over time.
  The code is all <a href="https://github.com/scrapinghub/pycon-speakers">available on GitHub</a>,
  and Gayane Petrosyan
  (currently at the <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> in New York City)
  has started <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pgayane/pycon-speakers/blob/dataanalysis/gender.ipynb">plotting</a>
  some of the results.
</p>

<p>
  It's a really cool project,
  and you really ought to fork it,
  add a scraper for a conference or two,
  and send a pull request with your results.
  If you're going to do that on a Mac,
  though,
  you may run into <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/693">a problem</a>.
  If you're using Continuum's <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a> installation of Python,
  then <code>pip install scrapy</code> fails
  with a lengthy stack trace and the cryptic message, "Reason: image not found."
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/team/#davis.m">Matt Davis</a>,
  eventually figured out that you have to set a shell variable before trying to install
  the Python <code>cryptography</code> library
  that Scrapy depends on:
</p>
<pre>
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/anaconda/lib
</pre>
<p>
  This piece of information didn't appear anywhere on the Internet
  (at least not that we could find).
  The clue that set us on the right path
  was a fix recommended in issue #693 from the <code>cryptography</code> library:
</p>
<pre>
env DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/ \
    ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64 -Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future" \
    LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" \
    CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include" \
    pip install cryptography
</pre>
<p>
  When I started this post,
  I planned to enumerate all the bits of background knowledge someone would need
  in order to solve this problem.
  The list quickly became unmanageable:
  environment variables and dynamically-loaded libraries in general,
  this particular variable and library in particular,
  the fact that the operating system's search for the latter
  can be controlled by the former,
  the way Python libraries can depend on compiled C libraries...
  There's a lot going on here,
  and most people,
  even ones who've been through a bootcamp,
  would give up on contributing to this project
  before they got the required software stack to work.
</p>
<p>
  This post isn't meant to be a criticism of Scrapy,
  the <code>cryptography</code> library,
  or Anaconda:
  they're all useful, well-engineered tools.
  Instead,
  my goal was to explain why we can't just teach people end-user tasks like data analysis.
  "Gender balance per conference over time" is a pretty innocuous question,
  but even someone who understands
  how to write a few lines of code to connect a scraping service
  to Python's Natural Language Toolkit
  would probably be defeated in this case.
</p>
<p>
  Pre-configured virtual machines and all-in-one installers aren't a solution to this problem:
  they only give you what their creators thought to include,
  and as soon as you want to take advantage of anything else,
  you're right back in the minefield.
  The internet isn't a solution either:
  I've been programming for over thirty years,
  and I didn't know that the magic word I needed was <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.
  What I <em>do</em> know is that
  every attempt I've seen to sprint for the finish line&mdash;to teach
  the skills people want to do
  before teaching the basic concepts those skills depend on&mdash;has produced more frustration than enlightenment.
  In the end,
  it turns out that my high school music teacher was right:
  if you want to play a solo,
  you have to learn your scales.

  Postscript:
  there were several comments on this post
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/site/pull/475">on GitHub</a>
  while it was still in draft;
  I've included them below,
  and more would be welcome.

<p>This is a good issue.  I know you were just picking this 
dynamic library problem an example, but it's one that's near to my heart
 as somebody who helps develop cross-platform tools.  Dynamic library 
loaders are very complicated pieces of machinery, and they present 
similar-yet-different interfaces on OS X, Windows, and Linux.  </p>

<p>I do believe that we're getting a lot better at providing 
"batteries-included" platforms for developers to work on, without having
 to understand the underlying guts of their tools.  It used to be that 
if you wanted to perform a computation involving solving a system of 
linear equations, you had to know how to write C or Fortran code, 
perhaps call the LAPACK library if you wanted it to be very fast, call 
the compiler, the linker, and maybe use a Makefile, all to run your code
 from the command line.</p>

<p>Nowadays, you can solve this system of equations in a single line of 
code in Python (using SciPy), MATLAB, or even on the web with tools like
 SageMathCloud or Wolfram Alpha.  We're making progress in layering 
low-level library dependencies away from users, but we're not done yet. 
 Tools like conda and hashdist are emerging specifically to help 
increase the range of experts, allowing developers to focus on building 
tools higher in the stack.</p>

<p>Packaging, interoperability, and portability remain as challenges in 
scientific computing, for all languages and platforms.  I think advances
 in tools and techniques will continue to have significant impact in 
improving productivity, aiding replicability and reproducibility, and 
reducing the need for scientists to set arcane environment variables to 
get their web scraper going.</p>

            <p>I think well-configured VMs and cloud computing machines <em>are</em>
 a solution; it's super hard to write software for everyone's individual
 laptop, but if I tell you "Ubuntu 12.04 with these packages, and here's
 how to install them with apt-get, and then build our software", well, 
that's just going to work.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Raniere Silva:</dt>
  <dd>
<p>VMs can help but sometimes they just make the problem "worse" because
 you will need specific versions of virtualization software, network 
configured properly, ... since the VM was made to "Ubuntu X" and you are
 using "Ubuntu Y".</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Titus Brown:</dt>
  <dd>
<p>sure, but the Ubuntu Long Term Support releases should mitigate that 
quite a bit -- I'm now relying on 12.04 for our scientific software, and
 12.04 is supported through 2017, I think.</p>

    <p>
It comes down to numbers: is the percentage of packages that JFI (Just
Install) high enough that most scientists, most of the time, don't run
into problems whose solution requires 10X the knowledge they have?
Python's `cryptography` library isn't a small or obscure package, and
Anaconda on Mac OS X isn't a rare combination; how long until events
like that on the VM of your choice are so infrequent as to be a non-issue?</p>

    <p><a href="http://docker.io/">Docker.io</a> might one-day help on the Linux platform, but as you point out, Macs are well, different.  </p>

<p>Additionally, when you write a piece of code people find useful then 
open source it.  If it becomes popular you will be dealing with a 
torrent of correspondence as people try to run your code on every 
conceivable software platform under the sun.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Aron Ahmadia:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>@gvwilson: I think we've crossed that bridge with the core SciPy Stack on the major platforms.</p>

<p>@ctb: The VM
 solution isn't a silver bullet, unfortunately.   For one, VMs don't 
work on supercomputers.  Additionally, as Greg alludes, when you combine
 more tools, you increase the risk that you will need a library at a 
version that isn't provided by the VM because the VM is too new or old, 
coming to the limits of "interoperability".  </p>

<p>Despite this, I think it remains to be seen whether we see VMs emerge
 on major HPC platforms, or installation-isolating tools like Docker, 
HashDist, or Conda enter mainstream popularity.</p>

  <dt>Neil Chue Hong:</dt>
  <dd>
            <p>The message I get from your post is: "This isn't as easy as we'd want it to be",</p>

<p>The reason I don't think VMs are the whole solution is that they 
don't - in their present general usage - solve the issue of me making 
multiple difficult to install tools work together.</p>

<p>Another solution - not necessarily the right one - is having an 
expert in every group/department who installs new software on a central 
set of managed machines for the group (aka the SysAdmin model or HPC 
centre model). But it can create an artificial divide between those who 
know what they'd like to do, and those who know what's possible on their
 machines. </p>

            <p>VMs don't solve everything. But they solve an awful lot, 
especially at the level that Software Carpentry students and instructors
 work at, and I wish I understood why people ignore 'em.  EOM. :)</p>

            <p>I would've much rather seen this interesting and useful 
discussion as comments on the published blog post, rather than in github
 on the draft blog post. :(</p>

            <p>Something like this happened to my partner and I during 
the SciPy 2013 git/testing tutorial. We got in a situation where git was
 refusing to commit our changes, and none of the usual suggested 
solutions from the instructors worked. In the end, the instructor had to
 "drive" and fix the problem, but we were all in a rush. It got fixed, 
but we didn't learn how. So ultimately my take home message regarding 
git was "here there be dragons."</p>
