<p>
  Last week we had our first meeting to discuss the development of the novice R
  material. Our goal was to determine our plan for collaboratively creating the
  lessons.
</p>

<h2>Current state of SWC R material</h2>
<p>
  We have already taught many R bootcamps. However, since there is no canoncial
  set of SWC lessons, SWC R instructors have been independently developing
  separate sets of lessons. Great material has been developed, but organizing
  and teaching a bootcamp is already a lot of work without also having to
  develop the curriculum. Furthermore, this approach divides our contributions
  leading to lots of duplicated effort. Ideally we would all contribute to the
  same lessons to create a better result than any of us could have acheived
  individually. However, this state of affairs was not surprising since
  <a href="../03/collaborative-lesson-development.html">collaborative lesson
  development</a> is still immature.
</p>
<p>
  Thus we had four main options to choose from:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Use an existing set of R materials as the base to build from.
  </li>
  <li>
    Combine multiple existing sets of R materials.
  </li>
  <li>
    Translate
    the <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/tree/master/novice/python">novice
    Python lessons</a> to R.
  </li>
  <li>
    Start from scratch.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Option #1 requires a lot of effort from the original creator of the materials
  since she or he is the most familiar with the state of the material (as an
  example, this is the option we chose for
  the <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/tree/master/intermediate/r">intermediate
  R lessons</a>, with <a href="https://github.com/karthik">Karthik Ram</a> not
  only developing the materials but also updating them after others reviewed
  each lesson). Option #2 has the benefit of combining the best parts of
  multiple sets of bootcamp lessons, but the big drawback is that it would
  require volunteers becoming familiar with the content of the multiple sets of
  lessons. Option #3 aligns the Python and R materials, but also presents the
  challenge of introducing R-specific control flow and data structures within a
  lesson originally developed for Python. Option #4 is the most open-ended
  option, but also requires the most work.
</p>
<h2>Our plan</h2>
<p>
  We decided on Option #3, translating the novice Python lessons to R. This
  allows the SWC R community to benefit from the recent discussion around
  creating novice Python material (and of course hopefully allow us to
  contribute back our findings from teaching these lessons at bootcamps to
  improve both the R and Python lessons). Here is our plan:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/sarahsupp">Sarah Supp</a> translated the Python
    lessons to R in Markdown format, which she used to teach at
    the <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/2014-03-17-nyu/">NYU bootcamp</a>
    on March 17th.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/dbarneche">Diego Barneche</a> translated the
    Markdown into R Markdown.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/gavinsimpson">Gavin Simpson</a> will perform the
    first edits to include more R-specific material.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/naupaka">Naupaka Zimmerman</a> will perform the
    second round of edits.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/jainsley">Joshua Ainsley</a> will perform the
    third round of edits.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Between each round of edits, everyone will be able to contribute
  comments/suggestions to the pull requests.
</p>
<h2>How to get involved</h2>
<p>
There are lots of ways you can get involved in the development of the novice R
material, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Join the
    <a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/listinfo/r-discuss">r-discuss</a>
    mailing list.
    </li>
  <li>
    Review the forthcoming pull requests.
  </li>
  <li>
    Test <a href="http://ramnathv.github.io/posts/rblocks-pkg">rblocks</a>, a
    new R package developed by <a href="https://github.com/ramnathv">Ramnath
    Vaidyanathan</a> to implement <a href="https://github.com/jiffyclub">Matt
    Davis'</a> <a href="http://ipythonblocks.org/">ipythonblocks</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create domain-specific lessons that could supplement the main novice R
    materials (I'd recommend proposing your idea on the mailing list prior to
    developing an entire lesson).
  </li>
</ul>
