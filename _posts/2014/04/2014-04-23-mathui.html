In <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/04/bridging-the-authoring-gap.html">a
previous post</a> Greg Wilson wrote about the writing gap
<blockquote>
  between people who value the "I can see what I'm doing" of Microsoft Word and
  those who care more about the "I can tell what I did" of version control.
</blockquote>
For STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) folks there is also the
gap related to math expressions (you can use LaTeX to deal with math
expressions but for beginners who spent around 20 years using
Microsoft Word moving to LaTeX can be challenging).
</p>
<p>Do you know that some people are working to solve the gap with math
expressions?</p>

Some of this people will be at an <a
  href="http://cermat.org/events/MathUI/14/">international workshop about
  mathematical user interfaces</a> (submission to works are still open) in July
to discuss how users interact with mathematics represented on a computer and
related topics.

<p>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/MathML_Project">Folks
  from Mozilla MathML Project</a> have also worked to solve this gap (like
enabling
<a href="http://fred-wang.github.io/TeXZilla/">real time preview of LaTeX
  equations</a> in web browsers) and invite you to take a look at the <a
  href="http://fred-wang.github.io/MathUI2014/">work they will submit</a> soon
which covers nice examples of the new web technologies that can be used to share
knowledge.
