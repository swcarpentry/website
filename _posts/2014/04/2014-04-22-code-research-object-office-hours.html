  Looking to learn more about
  <a href="http://mozillascience.github.io/code-research-object/">how to get a DOI for your code</a>?
  Interested in the <a href="https://github.com/mozillascience/fidgit">underlying technology</a>
  used to hook up GitHub (a code hosting service) and figshare (an open data repository)?
  Join us for our online office hours on <strong>Thursday, April 24</strong>.
  We'll be shedding light on the technical build done as part of our
  <a href="http://mozillascience.org/code-as-a-research-object-updates-prototypes-next-steps/">"code as a research object"</a>
  project.
</p>
<p>
  We'll be holding two sessions,
  one at <strong>11 am ET</strong> for those in North America, Europe, and Africa,
  and another at <strong>4 pm ET</strong> for our Australasian colleagues.
  These sessions are open to all,
  and are your chance to ask your implementation questions,
  gain a better understanding of how the <a href="http://mozillascience.github.io/code-research-object/">prototype</a> works,
  and peek under the hood at the codebase.
</p>
<p>
  Have a question?
  <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/sciencelab-coderesobject-officehours">Add it to the etherpad</a>,
  where you can also find useful background on the project as well as dial-in information.
  We hope you'll join us.
