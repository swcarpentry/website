<p>Paul Offit has a new book out called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Autisms-False-Prophets-Science-Medicine/dp/0231146361"><em>Autism's False Prophets</em></a>, which looks at how the myth about vaccination causing autism arose and spread.  As his <a href="http://www.babble.com/baby/baby-health-safety/dr-paul-offit-autism-and-vaccines-vaccination-safety-child-health/">condensed essay</a> on the subject says, it's a far from simple story, but one that has echoes in areas such as climate change where science and public policy must dine at the same table.  I still haven't decided whether open science will make a difference to this or not: putting data, calculations, and papers freely available online in real time will help scientists talk to one another, but I don't think it will help them communicate with the other 99.9% of our species.  Thoughts?</p>
