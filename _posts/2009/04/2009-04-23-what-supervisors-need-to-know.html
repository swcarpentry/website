<p>I received an interesting email yesterday from a grad student who took this course the last time it was offered at the University of Toronto.  It said in part:</p>
<p><em>My supervisor could better advise students doing computational work if they had more background knowledge.  They are routinely faced with questions like:<br />
</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em> Is a project possible, given the background of the student and the difficulty of the tasks?</em></li>
<li><em>How long should a project take, and what can be considered good progress?</em></li>
<li><em>What training should a student have?</em></li>
<li><em>How to manage collaboration between students, data archives, etc?</em></li>
<li><em>How to make sense of and build upon work done by previous students?</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em> On a more personal note&mdash;I would enjoy my supervisor having a clearer idea of what I do.</em></p>
<p>It's an interesting list, and quite different from a grad student's. What else do you think people directing computational research, rather than doing it themselves, need to know?</p>
