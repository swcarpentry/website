<p>The slides for my talk at the National Research Council on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gvwilson/we-know-less-than-you-think-but-we-do-know-something">empirical software engineering and how scientists actually use computers</a> are now up on SlideShare.  The colors in some of the embedded images were messed up during upload, but the result should still be readable.</p>
