<p><a href="http://www.fel.duke.edu/~scafetta/">Nicola Scafetta</a> is <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18307-sceptical-climate-researcher-wont-divulge-key-program.html">refusing to release the software</a> on which he bases his claims that the sun is responsible for much of terrestrial warming during the last century.  I obviously think that scientists should be required to do this as a condition of publication; coming as this does on the heels of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2009/11/caesars-wife.html">Climategate</a>, it will be interesting to see if journals finally start pushing in that direction. It also highlights the need to add more material to this course to cover packaging for release and data provenance.</p>
