<p>The warmup tutorials for our grassroots Software Carpentry course started this week, and we'd like to send a "thank you" to Jamie Winter at The MathWorks, who has provided students with temporary licenses for MATLAB. It's all been very last minute, and we're grateful to Jamie for pulling this off on such short notice.</p>
