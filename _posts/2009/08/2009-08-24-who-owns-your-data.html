<p><em>Nature</em>'s "Great Beyond" blog reports another attempt to <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2009/08/climate_researcher_vs_foi_part.html">force climate scientists to release their data</a>. I'm of at least two minds on this: I believe openness is absolutely crucial to science (and society as a whole), but I understand scientists' concern about being scooped, and equally their concern about having their work misrepresented or quoted out of context. Mostly, I come down on the side of openness&mdash;how about you?</p>
