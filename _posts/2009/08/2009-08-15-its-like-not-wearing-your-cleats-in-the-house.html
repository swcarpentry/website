<p>Carl Zimmer, one of my favorite science writers, recently posted about <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/08/11/book-preview-for-the-scientist/">three new books aimed at scientists</a>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465013058"><em>Unscientific America</em></a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674036352"><em>Am I Making Myself Clear?</em></a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597265632"><em>Don't Be Such a Scientist</em></a>. All three are aimed squarely at the biggest problem modern science faces&mdash;the inability of most scientists to explain themselves to non-specialists&mdash;and all three are now on my read-soon list. I don't think communication skills will ever be part of this course, but given the problems our planet faces, they damn well need to be part of every scientist's education.</p>
