<p>From <a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/">Cameron Neylon</a>, a <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/CameronNeylon/videos/7/">short video</a> showing how to embed molecules from the ChemSpider service into a wiki page. I was surprised and impressed to discover during his visit to Toronto just how little programming Cameron does: mostly, he leverages his understanding of how information moves around the Internet to plumb existing tools and services together. This is part of (or dependent on) what Jeannette Wing calls "<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~CompThink/">computational thinking</a>", and one of the goals for the next revision of this course is to focus more on those kinds of skills.</p>
