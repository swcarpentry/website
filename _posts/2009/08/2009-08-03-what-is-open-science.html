<p>Over at the OpenScience Project, Dan Gezelter is trying to define <a href="http://www.openscience.org/blog/?p=269">what "open science" means</a>. He thinks there are four key points:</p>
<ul>
<li> Transparency in experimental methodology, observation, and collection of data.</li>
<li> Public availability and reusability of scientific data.</li>
<li> Public accessibility and transparency of scientific communication.</li>
<li> Using web-based tools to facilitate scientific collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p>What changes need to be made to this course to prepare people to do these things effectively?</p>
