<p>The Perimeter Institute is organizing a ten-day science festival in Waterloo this October called "<a href="http://q2cfestival.com/">Quantum to Cosmos</a>". It promises to take you from the strange subatomic world of the quantum to the outer reaches of the cosmic frontier. And for those who can't make it, all events will be streamed online live and on demand 24 hours a day.  Hope to see you there!</p>
