<p>XML in the morning, regular expressions in the afternoon&mdash;it's been a long week, but a productive one (I hope).  We're going to shuffle some of the material around so that we can do binary data processing, web client and server programming, and GUI programming next week.  The highlight, of course, will be the guest speakers on Wednesday afternoon.  I hope the students have a restful weekend; I'm looking forward to the last lap.</p>
