<p>Yesterday (Monday) morning we covered the basics of handling binary data, including bit twiddling and the use of Python's struct module to pack and unpack binary representations of objects.  The afternoon was a lightning introduction to how the web works: a simple socket example (just to show students the plumbing) was followed by a description of HTTP's requests and responses, then a look at urllib.  Today is going to be devoted to the absolute bare bones of server-side programming, with GUI programming using Tkinter as a follow-up.  "Fast paced" doesn't even touch it, but I hope students will come away with an idea of what's possible, and where to look for more information.</p>
