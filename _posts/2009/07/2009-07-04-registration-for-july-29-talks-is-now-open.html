<p>As part of this summer's run of the course, we have organized an afternoon of public talks from a stellar lineup of speakers. The event is free, but registration is required, and you can now sign up at <a href="http://science20.eventbrite.com/">http://science20.eventbrite.com/</a>.  The talks will run 1-6 pm on Wednesday, July 29, and will be followed by a wine and cheese.  For details, including speaker bios and abstracts for their talks, see the "Guest Speakers" page.</p>
