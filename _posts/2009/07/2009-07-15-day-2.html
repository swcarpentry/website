<p>After three Python lectures yesterday, we slowed down a bit today and looked at a pair of tools every professional programmer relies on: symbolic debuggers and version control systems. <a href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~paullu/">Paul Lu</a> covered the former topic using <a href="http://www.wingware.com/">WingIDE</a>; <a href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~kwbauer/">Ken Bauer</a> covered the latter using the <a href="http://www.syntevo.com/smartsvn/index.html">SmartSVN</a> GUI for <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>.  Working in pairs seems to agree with the students, though as is so often the case, installing and configuring tools is often more work than actually using them.  We'll look at Python's sets and dictionaries tomorrow morning, then <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~pgries">Paul Gries</a> will give a quick introduction to image processing in the afternoon.</p>
