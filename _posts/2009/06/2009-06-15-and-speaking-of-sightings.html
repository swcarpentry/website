<p>A new (but very rough) version of the slides for the course is now up at <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">http://software-carpentry.org</a>.  This uses <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">Eric Meyer's S5 package</a> for formatting and pagination (along with a short Python script to insert cross-references).  We were planning to use LaTeX, but after messing around with packages, dependencies, and the like, HTML started to look at lot simpler.  We still have a lot of reformatting to do (particularly with tables and code inclusions); if you'd like to help, or if you are a CSS expert and can help make the slides look good with Internet Explorer (right now they're styled for Firefox), please let us know.</p>
