<p>The latest in a series of workshops on "<a href="http://www.cs.ua.edu/~SECSE09/">Software Engineering for Computational Science and Engineering</a>" was held in Vancouver on May 23, just after <a href="http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/events/icse2009/home/">ICSE'09</a>. Steve Easterbrook has written a <a href="http://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/?p=497">good summary</a> of what was discussed, and <a href="http://www.cs.ua.edu/~carver/">Jeffrey Carver</a>'s longer summary will appear in a future issue of <a href="http://cise.aip.org/"><em>Computing in Science and Engineering</em></a>.</p>
