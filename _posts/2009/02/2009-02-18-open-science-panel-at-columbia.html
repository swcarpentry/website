<p>Via Jon Pipitone: there's a panel discussion tomorrow at Columbia titled "<a href="http://scholcomm.columbia.edu/2009/03/02/open-science-good-for-research-good-for-researchers/">Open Science: Good For Research, Good For Researchers?</a>" Jean-Claude Bradley, Barry Canton, and Bora Zivkovic are all going to be there, and yes, video will be distributed.  I'm looking forward to it&mdash;it'll be a lot of thinking on <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/2035.html">computer supported collaborative science</a> in one place.</p>
