<p><a href="http://www.scibarcamp.org/">SciBarCamp</a> is weekend unconference for scientists, artists, and technologists.  The goal is to create connections between science, entrepreneurs and local businesses, and arts and culture. I think this is a great idea, and wish I could attend (I already have a plane ticket for <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/sigcse08/">SIGCSE</a> in Portland); it's free, but there is only space for around 100 people, so please register by sending an email to <a href="mailto:dodd.jen@gmail.com">Jen Dodd</a>.</p>
