<p>Titus Brown's <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/dec-08/its-not-the-tools-folks.html">latest post</a> (which opens with, "The latest hot idea for making a protein-protein interaction database leaves me lukewarm") should be read by every computer scientist who's "just trying to help":</p>
<blockquote><p>...while tools can be helpeful, the fundamental problem is much more, well, fundamental: science is <em>hard</em>.  Connecting the dots is <em>hard</em>.  Thinking clearly about the problem and separating the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, is <em>hard</em>.  I worry that for the majority of biologists, new tools are going to be more distracting than helpful.  We need to build simpler, easier-to-use tools, not more complicated tools; we need to keep our focus on the goal (solving biological problems) and not just on intermediate stages like improving databases and building better prediction tools.</p></blockquote>
