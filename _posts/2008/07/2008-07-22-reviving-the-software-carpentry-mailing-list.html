<p>Luke Petrolekas and I are <em>thiiiiis</em> close to having the Software Carpentry notes converted to a wiki. Once they are, I'm going to be working with Tina Yee to update them, do the examples in MATLAB as well as Python, and fix some longstanding bugs.  I'm also going to resurrect the project's two mailing lists (one for occasional announcements, the other for people interested in developing new material and/or teaching the course).  If you'd like to be on either or both, please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">let us know</a>.</p>
