<p>Coming back to the <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1677.html">badge meme</a> from earlier this week, John Cook's new <a href="http://www.reproducibleresearch.net/blog/">Reproducible Research blog</a> pointed me at <a href="http://rr.epfl.ch/17/">this page</a> on the <a href="http://rr.epfl.ch">EPFL</a> site advertising a paper called "What, Why and How of Reproducible Research in Signal Processing".  Notice the "Reproducible Research" badge?  The "add your evaluation" link takes you to a formlet that lets you choose between:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have tested this code and it works</li>
<li>I have tested this code and it does not work (on my computer)</li>
<li>I have tested this code and was able to reproduce the results from the paper</li>
<li>I have tested this code and was unable to reproduce the results from the paper</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a good start...</p>
