<p>Via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/05/29/bioscientists-photos.html">BoingBoing</a>, a story about scientists Photoshopping experimental results. Sometimes it's outright fakery; sometimes they're just "cleaning up" or "correcting". Either way, it raises an interesting question: how often are people doing this with computational results? Without scientists' code, or any other way to <a href="http://www.reproducibleresearch.org/">reproduce their work</a>, we'll probably never know.</p>
