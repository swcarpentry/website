<p>We are members of a software research group from Queen's University who are investigating ideas and tools to assist with the development of scientific software. We are starting a project focused on finding silent or hidden errors in scientific code. (Silent errors are errors that don't result in a crash, an error message or an other obvious indicator of a problem.) To create a catalogue of common silent errors, we would like to hear debugging "war stories" from computational scientists. Using these stories we hope to provide improved code testing techniques specifically for scientists.</p>
<p>To conduct our study, we are looking for scientific software debugging stories: just a few lines explaining what the problem was and how you managed to solve it. You can contribute to our study by sending us a story and/or by passing this email along to colleagues who might be able to help with a story.</p>
<p>Please navigate to <del>http://www.cs.queensu.ca/~hook/err_intro.html</del> for more details if you are interested in contributing an error story to this study.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Daniel Hook and Diane Kelly</p>
