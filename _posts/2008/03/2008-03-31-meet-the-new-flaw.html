<p>I was pretty excited when I heard that Microsoft was getting into scientific computing.  As the world's biggest desktop software company, I figured they might understand that scientific computing and high-performance computing are <em>not</em> automatically the same thing, and that reliability and reproducibility are more important than peak performance.  Turns out I was wrong: the workshop I attended last September was dominated by discussion of topics like GPU programming and computational grids that are still bleeding-edge computer science, rather than the nuts and bolts that would actually help most scientists be productive day-to-day, Microsoft's new HPC++ Computational Finance lab's site [since closed] has a lot on speed but nothing on correctness, <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/03/27/cluster-computing-with-large-data-for-the-classroom/">et cetera</a>.</p>
<p>So where should they be spending their time?  If I ran the world, they'd start by reading <a href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~donoho/Reports/1995/wavelab.pdf">Buckheit and Donoho</a> on reproducible research, double back to Jon Claerbout's <a href="http://sepwww.stanford.edu/sep/jon/reproducible.html">notes</a> on the same, check out the <a href="http://rsf.sourceforge.net">Madagascar</a> project, and then try to figure out how to scale up those ideas to hundreds of thousands of scientists and publications in as diverse a range of fields as possible.  It won't give the senator something to stand beside on opening day, but it'll do science a lot more good.</p>
