<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>Toronto-area startup <a href="http://learnhub.com">LearnHub.com</a> has launched their new e-learning site with <a href="http://swc.learnhub.com/">part</a> of the Software Carpentry course as their featured offering.  I'm looking forward to meeting a whole new batch of students... ;-)</p>
