<p>Via <a href="http://www.controlledflight.ca/2008/05/26/how-can-we-tell-when-were-done/">Irving Reid</a>, a great quote from <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/agile-version-control">Henrik Kniberg</a> about how to tell when you're done:</p>
<blockquote><p>So when a team member says that a story is Done and moves the story card into the Done column, a customer could run into the room at that moment and say "Great Lets go live now", and nobody in the team will say "no, but wait".</p></blockquote>
<p>Ironically, Kniberg's post is called "Version Control for Multiple Agile Teams". Why ironic? Because I was talking yesterday to a professor in my department &mdash; young guy, smart, already has a better research and publication record than I'll ever have. I brought up version control (as in, "Why do less than 10% of faculty and grad students use it?"); his reply was, "Well, we're just going to back everything up once a day."</p>
