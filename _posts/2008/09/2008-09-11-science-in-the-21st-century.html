<p>I'm at the "<a href="http://www.science21stcentury.org/">Science in the 21st Century</a>" conference at the <a href="http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/">Perimeter Institute</a> today.  There are 32 people in the room right now: 23 are male and 9 are female, but only one is non-Caucasian, which pretty much matches the numbers in the <a href="http://science21stcentury.org/photo21.jpg">picture</a> from the conference dinner last night.  That's about the same M/F ratio I see in science grad courses at U of T, but definitely <em>not</em> the ethnic distribution&mdash;wonder why?  It can't just be a "seniority effect" &mdash; this is a pretty young crowd.  We see the same thing at DemoCamp: non-Caucasians are often a majority n sci/tech classes and companies in the Greater Toronto Area, but definitely a minority on Tuesday nights.  Thoughts? <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org">Michael Nielsen</a> says that <a href="http://www.scibarcamp.org/">SciBarCamp</a> was 50/50...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nyls.edu/pages/591.asp">Beth Noveck</a>:  "Designing Digital Institutions: Science in Government 2.0".  Talked about crowdsourcing patent review; wonder if U of T would run a grad course for sci/eng students to teach them how to do this (and as a side effect, get them to do some useful patent reviewing)?  Might be a good central theme for a tech reading/writing course.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eric-weinstein.net/">Eric Weinstein</a>: "Sheldon Glashow Owes Me a Dollar". His main point seemed to be that radical thinkers need to find wealthy benefactors (Medicis or Gates) in order to have the freedom to pursue really wild ideas. What I took away from it was how fundamentally the influx of physicists into banking is reshaping the language used by the latter.</p>
