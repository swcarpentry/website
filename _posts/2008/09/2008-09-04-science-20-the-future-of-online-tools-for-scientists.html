<p>A pub night and panel with Timo Hannay, Cameron Neylon, and Michael Nielsen, hosted by Nature Network Toronto</p>
<p>What does the future hold for the way we do science?  Are online repositories such as GenBank and the physics preprint ArXiv, or social tools such as Nature Network, about to change science profoundly?  To find out, join Nature Network Toronto for an interactive panel discussion over drinks at the pub.</p>
<p>Date: Sunday September 7 at 7:30pm</p>
<p>Place: <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=181+university+ave+toronto&amp;sll=46.55886,-95.712891&amp;sspn=34.760328,92.8125&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr">Fionn MacCool's</a> (181 University Avenue, near corner with Adelaide)</p>

He is responsible for new online initiatives in social software,  databases and audio-visual content.  Timo trained as a neurophysiologist at the University of Oxford and worked as a journalist and a management consultant before becoming a publisher.</p>
<p><em>Cameron Neylon</em> is a biophysicist working in molecular biology, biophysics, and high throughput methods.  He has a joint appointment as a Lecturer in Combinatorial Chemistry at the University of Southampton and as a Senior Scientist in Biomolecular Sciences at the ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Facility.  He is developing an electronic notebook for biochemistry labs which has lead to his involvement in the Open Research movement and to his group moving to an Open Notebook.</p>
<p><em>Michael Nielsen</em> is a writer living just outside Toronto, Canada. He is currently working on a book about <cite>The Future of Science</cite>.  One of the pioneers of quantum computation, he coauthored the standard text on quantum computation that is the most highly cited physics publication of the last 25 years. He is the author of more than fifty scientific papers, including invited contributions to <cite>Nature</cite> and <cite>Scientific American</cite>.</p>
