  It's been a depressing couple of weeks.
  On top of yet more reports of universities turning a blind eye to sexual harassment for years,
  a <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/1733/">new paper</a> of gender bias in open source
  shows that,
  "...women's contributions tend to be accepted more often than men's.
  However, when a woman's gender is identifiable, they are rejected more often."
  This comes on top of earlier studies
  (like <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~bvasiles/papers/socinfo12.pdf">this one</a>)
  showing that women are substantially less well represented in open online forums like Stack Overflow
  than in computing as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  This prompted me to take another look at how Software Carpentry is doing---in particular,
  at how online participation compares to in-person participation.
  The two tables below compare the number and percentage of people teaching workshops
  in the whole of 2015
  with the number and percentage contributing to our repositories in January 2016.
  (I'd really like to compare like against like by getting GitHub data for the whole of 2015,
  but <a href="{{site.filesurl}}/2016/02/balance/bin/get-repo.py">my script</a>
  won't fetch stuff from that far back.)
  Each table shows both the number of distinct people and the number of distinct "events":
  if someone taught three workshops,
  for example,
  they show up as one person but as three events,
  and similarly for contributions to repositories.

  This data tells me that:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Women are somewhat over-represented among teachers,
    while men are over-represented among repository contributors,
    but the differences are fairly small.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ignoring instructors whose gender is unknown,
    30% of in-class instructors are women.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  I'd like to add columns showing the gender breakdown of messages to our lists---if
  anyone knows enough about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/">Mailman</a> to do that,
  please give me a shout.
