We are pleased to announce that
[Alex Konovalov](http://blogs.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/alexk/) and his colleagues
have created a Software Carpentry-style lesson on
[the computational algebra system GAP](http://www.gap-system.org).
The lesson is at [http://alex-konovalov.github.io/gap-lesson/](http://alex-konovalov.github.io/gap-lesson/),
and the repository for it is at [https://github.com/alex-konovalov/gap-lesson](https://github.com/alex-konovalov/gap-lesson).
It was taught at [a recent workshop](https://kkwakwa.github.io/2015-11-16-manchester-codima/),
and feedback can be viewed [here](https://github.com/alex-konovalov/2015-11-16-manchester-codima-feedback/blob/master/raw-feedback.md).

We are now starting to develop [a lesson on SageMath](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/GDg4liTgoss).
We invite collaborators, please watch [the repository](https://github.com/alex-konovalov/sage-lesson) if you're interested in following along,
and add a comment to [this issue](https://github.com/alex-konovalov/sage-lesson/issues/1) if you're interested in contributing.
