The [University of Washington eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/), in collaboration with
[Urban@UW](http://urban.uw.edu/) and Microsoft, is excited to announce the 2016
Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) summer program. The program brings together
data and domain scientists to work on focused, collaborative projects that are
designed to impact public policy for social benefit.

Modeled after similar programs at the [University of Chicago](http://dssg.uchicago.edu/) and [Georgia Tech](http://dssg-atl.com/),
with elements from our own [Data Science Incubator](http://escience.washington.edu/get-involved/incubator-programs/winter-2016/), sixteen DSSG Student Fellows
will be selected to work with academic researchers, data scientists, and public
stakeholder groups on data-intensive research projects. Graduate students and
advanced undergraduates are eligible for these paid positions.

This yearâ€™s projects will focus on Urban Science, aiming to understand and
extract valuable, actionable information out of data from urban environments
across topic areas including public health, sustainable urban planning, crime
prevention, education, transportation, and social justice.
