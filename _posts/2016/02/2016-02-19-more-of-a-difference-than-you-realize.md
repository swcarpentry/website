We received this after an online instructor training workshop earlier this week,
which reminded me that small differences for some people
can be large ones for others:

> Thanks for a great workshop the last two days...
> I wanted to share a separate positive comment that I should have included on the Etherpad:
> I'm profoundly/severely hard-of-hearing in both ears,
> and depend quite a bit on lip-reading when listening to people.
> As such,
> I have great difficulty with online material if the audio is bad,
> the speaker is not well lit,
> or the speaker is simply not on video.
> 
> This was the first online course I've taken where there were several sites participating,
> and there was the use of software (Etherpad) for collaborative interaction.
> I have to admit I was dubious at first at how well this would all work for me with you in one corner,
> the audience in another,
> and stuff happening on the etherpad. 
> 
> In the end, I think it was fantastic.
> Having everybody collaboratively take notes worked out really well,
> because then if I didn't quite get something,
> I could wait and see if somebody else typed up the information or I could ask about it in the chat window.
> I did have trouble hearing the audio from some of the other sites, but it wasn't critical.
> 
> Thanks again for a great class.
