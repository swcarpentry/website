The [latest podcast from Research in Action](http://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/research/podcast/e31/)
features Dr. Tracy Teal,
Executive Director of [Data Carpentry]({{site.dc_url}}).
In 33 minutes (plus a couple of bonus clips),
Tracy talks about the mission of Data Carpentry,
how it came to be,
and how people can get involved as learners, instructors, and lesson developers.
It's a great introduction for newcomers,
and has a lot of tidbits that long-time participants will find fun and interesting as well.
