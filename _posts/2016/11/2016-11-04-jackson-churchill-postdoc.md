The [Churchill Lab] (http://churchill-lab.jax.org/website/) at The Jackson Laboratory is seeking a Postdoctoral
Fellow in systems biology. Our group applies a systems approach to study the genetics of health and disease. We
develop new methods and software to improve the power of quantitative trait locus mapping and high throughput
sequence analysis. We are especially interested in the genetics of aging and metabolic
disorders.

[The Jackson Laboratory] (http://www.jax.org) in Bar Harbor, Maine, USA, is recognized internationally for its
excellence in research, unparalleled mouse resources, outstanding training environment characterized by scientific
collaboration and exceptional core services - all within a spectacular setting adjacent to Acadia National Park.
The Jackson Laboratory was voted among the top 15 “Best Places to Work in Academia” in the United States in a poll
conducted by The Scientist magazine.

Exceptional postdoctoral candidates will have the opportunity to apply to become a JAX Postdoctoral Scholar, a
selective award addressing the national need for research scientists who are accomplished in the broadly defined 
fields of genetics and genomics. The award includes an independent research budget, travel funds, and a salary
above standard postdoctoral scale.

Applicants must have a PhD (or equivalent degree) in quantitative biology or another quantitative discipline such
as computer science, physics, or applied mathematics. Experience in statistical genetics and gene expression
analysis is strongly recommended, and applicants must have a commitment to solving biological problems and good 
communication skills. Expertise in scientific programming languages including R or Python is recommended. The
successful candidate will work on the genetics of aging or metabolic disorders.
