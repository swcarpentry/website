The Software Carpentry Foundation relies on volunteer efforts to
achieve many of its goals. It is now inaugurating a Community Service
Award as a way for its Steering Committee to recognize work which, in
its opinion, significantly improves the Foundation's fulfillment of
its mission and benefits the broader community.  Details are available
on [this page]({{site.url}}/scf/awards/); nominations are welcome at
any time, and we will make the first awards before the end of this
year.
