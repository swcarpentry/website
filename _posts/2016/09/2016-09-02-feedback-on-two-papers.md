We would be very grateful for feedback on two papers co-authored by members of our community:

*   Taschuk & Wilson: "[Ten Simple Rules for Making Research Software More Robust](http://oicr-gsi.github.io/robust-paper/)".

*   Wilson, Bryan, Cranston, Kitzes, Nederbragt, & Teal: "[Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing]({{site.github_io_url}}/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/)".

Each paper has a link at the top to send us email;
we look forward to hearing from you.
