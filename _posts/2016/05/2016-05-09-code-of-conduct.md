The amazing Software and Data Carpentry community of instructors and learners is
the foundation of our organizations. We have more than 500 instructors from 30
countries and have had over 20,000 learners in our workshops.

Software and Data Carpentry are community driven organizations. We value the
involvement of everyone in this community - learners, instructors, hosts,
developers, steering committee members, and staff. We are committed to creating
a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All
participants in Software and Data Carpentry events or communications are
expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

Core to our organizations is creating a friendly and welcoming community.
Therefore, we would like to reiterate that anyone participating in Software and
Data Carpentry activities must comply with our [Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/conduct}}). This code of
conduct applies to all spaces managed by Software and Data Carpentry, including,
but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums.

We are so fortunate to have such a strong and supportive community of
contributors, instructors, and learners and we are committed to supporting and
maintaining that community!
