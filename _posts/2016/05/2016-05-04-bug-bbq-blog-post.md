## Software Carpentry is having a Bug BBQ on June 13th

Software Carpentry is aiming to ship a new version (5.4) of the Software Carpentry lessons 
by the end of June. To help get us over the finish line we are having a Bug BBQ on June 
13th to squash as many bugs as we can before we publish the lessons. The June 13th Bug BBQ 
is also an opportunity for you to engage with our world-wide community. For more info 
about the event, read-on and visit our [Bug BBQ website](http://swcarpentry.github.io/SWC-bug-bbq/).

How can you participate? We're asking you, members of the Software Carpentry community, to 
spend a few hours on June 13th to wrap up outstanding tasks to improve the lessons. Ahead 
of the event, the lesson maintainers will be creating milestones to identify all the 
issues and pull requests that need to be resolved we wrap up version 5.4. In addition to 
specific fixes laid out in the milestones, we also need help to proofread and bugtest the 
lessons.  

Where will this be? Join in from where you are: No need to go anywhere - if you'd like to 
participate remotely, start by having a look at the milestones on the [website](http://swcarpentry.github.io/SWC-bug-bbq/) 
to see what tasks are still open, and send a pull request with your ideas to the 
corresponding repo. If you'd like to get together with other people working on these 
lessons live, we have created [this map](https://github.com/swcarpentry/SWC-bug-bbq/blob/gh-pages/sites.geojson) for live sites that are 
being organized. And if there's no site listed near you, organize one yourself and let us 
know you are doing that [here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/SWC-bug-bbq/issues) so that we 
can add your site to the map!  	

The Bug BBQ is going to be a great chance to get the community together, get our latest 
lessons over the finish line, and wrap up a product that gives you and all our contributors 
credit for your hard work with a citable object - we will be minting a DOI for this on 
publication.
