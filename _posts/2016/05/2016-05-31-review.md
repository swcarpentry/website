The [joint partnership agreement]({{page.baseurl}}/scf/join/) with Data Carpentry is now available, together with a [written version of the instructor training model]({{site.training_url}}), a [call for subcommittees and task forces]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/04/subcommittes-taskforces.html), and an [official space on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/17942228448/).
