Hi,

I'm a bioinformatician at a research lab in rural Maine, U.S.A. My path here has been 
winding, varied, and fraught with good luck. I had the good fortune to find Software 
Carpentry some years ago, and in my travels have never found anything quite like it. I'm 
honored to be part of this community and now want to give back by contributing my 
experience and expertise.

Previous involvement
-----

I've been a certified Software Carpentry instructor since the spring of 2015. Since then, 
I've organized and taught 6 workshops, and have plans to teach 5 more in early 2017. I 
serve on the mentoring subcommittee and lead discussion sessions for new and experienced 
instructors. Presently, I'm working toward becoming an instructor-trainer, and expect to 
teach instructor training early in 2017 in addition to the 5 aforementioned workshops. 
This year I secured 4 years of partnership funding between 
[The Jackson Laboratory] (http://www.jax.org) and the Carpentries. The first year of
partnership is funded by an internal grant, with succeeding years funded by a grant from 
the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).

How I can contribute
-----

I bring an uncommon perspective from formal teacher training and an 8-year career as a
K-12 teacher in the U.S. and Latin America. Diverse abilities and cultures in the 
classroom are the norm for me, and I have much to share with instructors about how to best 
meet everyone's needs - the first thing being a focus on learners' needs. My training 
instilled the idea that the learner, not the instructor, is the most important person in 
the room. A learner-centered approach to instruction responds well to diversity and arms 
the instructor with tools to adapt instruction to new situations and new people. Many of 
these tools work equally well with both child and adult learners, and work across cultures 
and abilities. 

I entered biomedical research in the early 2000s and have contributed my teaching expertise
to the field since then. I'm well-acquainted with the need for improved computing and data
analysis skills in research and know that the Carpentry approach promotes greater research
productivity and happiness. I'll bring this understanding to instructor training and 
mentoring to bolster instructional expertise within the Carpentry community.

I will help Software Carpentry to expand its training and instructional footprint into 
new regions, especially in Latin America, by teaching and by mentoring instructors there. 
In January 2017 I will teach  workshops at the Talleres Internacionales de Bioinformática 
(International Bioinformatics Workshops) in Cuernavaca, Morelos, México. I intend to 
follow this with further training in Latin American countries, and to support those
already teaching in these countries.

I will contribute grant-writing expertise to grow and sustain Software Carpentry by 
identifying and pursuing new sources of funding from foundations, government grants and 
institutional partnerships. I'm presently working on a NIH grant proposal and have 
shared the proposal with key NIH staff. I'm especially interested in pursuing funding
that will broaden Software Carpentry into different communities than those it already 
represents well.

My goals are the following:
-----

1. **Bolster instructional capacity and expertise** by training and mentoring new 
instructors in all disciplines.
2. **Broaden Software Carpentry's reach** into largely untapped regions, especially in 
Latin America.
3. **Build Software Carpentry** into a sustainable, well-funded organization that reaches
a diverse audience.
