The [R consortium Infrastructure Steering Committee awards](https://www.r-consortium.org/news/announcement/2016/03/r-consortium-funds-technical-initiatives-community-events-and-training)
have been officially announced and we are happy to confirm that
[our proposal](https://github.com/lgatto/SC-ICS-Proposal) to organise an
R-based instructor training was successful.

We will organise an in-person instructor training that will focus
on R. While the content of the training will not change as such,
code-related exercises and examples that the participants will be
working with will be focused on R, and will be made available to the R
instructor community to help them improve their teaching. The full
proposal is available [here](https://github.com/lgatto/SC-ICS-Proposal/blob/master/SC-ISC-proposal.md).

We are now waiting for all the paperwork to be finalised.  The next step is
to decide where to organise the training---see
[this issue](https://github.com/lgatto/SC-ICS-Proposal/issues/9) for
requirements and share your suggestions. If you would like to
participate, please register your interest
[here](https://github.com/lgatto/SC-ICS-Proposal/blob/master/participants.md)
by sending a pull request.

We thank the R consortium for their support and look forward to
organising our R-based instructor training.
