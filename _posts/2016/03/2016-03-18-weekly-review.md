##Instructor Training
* How can we [help instructor trainees complete their training]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/03/proposal-instructor-trainees.html)? Belinda Weaver is working hard to support new instructors in Australia. Do you have any other ideas?
* Several opportunities are now available for new and experienced instructors to join the conversations about workshops. Should we be [combining various sessions to better integrate new and old instructors and give more options for participation]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/03/should-we-combine-debriefing-and-lesson-discussion.html)?
* You can also read about the abovementioned discussions in the [latest summary of instructor debriefing rounds 4 and 5]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/03/instructor-debriefing-round-04-05.html).

##Conversations
* Over the last few weeks a very interesting discussion took place on our [discuss mailing list](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss/2016-March/thread.html#4002) about version control beyond git and svn. The conversation was prompted by an [initial post by Arjun Raj](http://rajlaboratory.blogspot.co.za/2016/02/from-reproducibility-to-over.html). Arjun summarised his view on the discussion in a follow-up post titled: [From over-reproducibility to a reproducibility wish-list](http://rajlaboratory.blogspot.co.za/2016/03/from-over-reproducibility-to.html).

##New
* A new [Data Carpentry Genomics lesson](https://github.com/qingpeng/2016-02-22-isu/tree/gh-pages/lessons) and [Defensive Programming with Python lesson](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder/blob/gh-pages/index.md) were discussed during [round 4 & 5 of instructor training debriefing]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/03/instructor-debriefing-round-04-05.html). Please read their post and visit the repos for more information. There are also many other cool tools and tips for new and experienced instructors in this post.

##Events
* The [3rd Annual Big Data in Biology Summer School](http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/summerschool.html) will take place at the University of Texas at Austin from 23-26 May 2016. 11 courses will be scheduled over four half-days each and include topics such as basic computational skills, Genomics, and Proteomics.

##Other
* The DataOne Webinar with Greg Wilson titled [Research Computing Skills for Scientists: Lessons, Challenges, and Opportunities from Software Carpentry](https://www.dataone.org/webinars/research-computing-skills-scientists-lessons-challenges-and-opportunities-software) is now available online.
*  What is the [difference between commercial and scientific software]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/03/complexity-vs-subtlety.html)? Please share your thoughts. 
* Byron Smith built on the Software Carpentry Make lessons to develop a [Make tutorial](http://blog.byronjsmith.com/make-analysis.html) for Titus Brown's week-long Bioinformatics Workshop at UC Davis's Bodega Marine Laboratory in February, 2016. 
* Aleksandra Pawlik recently spoke about [Supporting Research Software Community Through Training](http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-03-08-supporting-research-software-community-though-training) at the [eResearch New Zealand conference](http://eresearch2016.org.nz/). [The talk](http://www.slideshare.net/anpawlik/supporting-research-software-community-through-training) focused on the development of Software and Data Carpentry in the UK.
* 15 workshops were run over the past 15 days. For more information about past workshops, please visit our [website]({{page.baseurl}}/workshops/past/)
