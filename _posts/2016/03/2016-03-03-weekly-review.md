##Highlights
* Our [new steering committee]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/election-results.html) has been elected. Congratulations to Rayna Harris, Kate Hertweck, Karin Lagesen, Bill Mills, Raniere Silva, Belinda Weaver, and Jason Williams!
* Looking for a good model to show potentially interested stakeholders [what value Software Carpentry brings]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/03/venn-diagram.html)? Jonah Duckles, our executive director, shared his views. Let us know how we can improve on this? 

##Webinars
* DataONE is hosting Greg Wilson for a webinar titled [Research Computing Skills for Scientists: Lessons, Challenges, and Opportunities from Software Carpentry](https://www.dataone.org/upcoming-webinar) on 8 March 2016 at 9am Pacific Time. 

##New
* Over the past three years the rOpenSci community have learnt some interesting lessons about community building and open software.  Their [paper describing these lessons learnt]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/ropensci-paper.html) are now published and may provide some valuable insights to others on similar journeys.
* The new instructor training pipeline is starting to ramp up. Five people are now qualified to train instructors while the next round of [instructor trainer training]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/new-instructor-pipeline.html) is already underway. 
* We're currently in the lesson building phase for [Modern Scientific Authoring]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/collaboration-counterpoint.html). Comments and contributions are very welcome.

##Vacancies
* The Bioinformatics Training Facility of the School of Biological Sciences, University of Cambridge is looking for a [Training Impact Co-ordinator]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/bioinformatics-training-impact-job.html).

##Other
* Did you realise that collaborative tools such as the etherpad could be tremendously useful for [learners with (even slight) disabilities]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/more-of-a-difference-than-you-realize.html)?
* We recently published some [statistics on gender representation]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/checking-the-balance.html) in the Software Carpentry community in response to a new paper on gender bias in open source. The paper has since received strong critique, but our stats remain.
* The first [six ELIXIR Software and Data Carpentry instructors](https://www.elixir-europe.org/news/first-six-elixir-trainers-receive-software-and-data-carpentry-instructors-certificate?utm_content=buffer063ce&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) recently received their instructor certification. Read more about [ELIXR Software and Data Carpentry activities](http://elixir-uk.org/node-events/software-and-data-carpentry-instructor-training-at-the-university-of-lausanne).
