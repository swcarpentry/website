Thanks to their recent funding,
[rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/) is now looking for a community manager.
Their mission is to expand access to scientific data
and promote a culture of reproducible research and sustainable research software;
to aid that,
the community manager's job will be
to broaden the understanding and reach of rOpenSci to the researcher community.
For details,
please see [the full announcement](http://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/10/community-manager-position).
