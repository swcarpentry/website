If you could access hundreds or thousands of computers for your scholarly work, what could you do? 

How could it transform your work?

What discoveries might you make?

We are seeking applicants for the **2016 Open Science Grid (OSG) User
School**, which takes place **25–29 July** at the beautiful University of
Wisconsin in Madison. Participants will learn to use high throughput
computing (HTC) to harness vast amounts of computing power for research,
applicable to nearly any field of study (e.g., physics, chemistry,
engineering, life sciences, earth sciences, agricultural and animal
sciences, economics, social sciences, medicine, and more).

Using lectures, discussions, roleplays, and lots of hands-on work with
OSG experts in HTC, participants will learn how HTC systems work, how to
run and manage many jobs and huge datasets to implement a full
scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for help and more info.

Successful applicants will receive financial support to attend the OSG
School, covering all basic travel, hotel, and food costs.

Ideal candidates are graduate students whose research involves or could
involve large-scale computing — work that cannot be done on one laptop
or a handful of computers. We also accept post-doctoral students,
faculty, staff, and advanced undergraduates, so make a good case for
yourself!

## Important Dates 

Application Period **(OPEN NOW)**: 14 March – 15 April 2016
