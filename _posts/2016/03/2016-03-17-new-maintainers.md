We are pleased to announce that [Harriet Dashnow]({{site.baseurl}}/team/#dashnow_harriet)
and [Daniel Chen]({{site.baseurl}}/team/#chen_daniel)
have agreed to take over maintenance of [the R inflammation lesson]({{site.github_url}}/r-novice-inflammation).
Our thanks to them for volunteering,
and to [John Blischak]({{site.baseurl}}/team/#blischak_j)
and [Denis Haine]({{site.baseurl}}/team/#haine_denis)
for all their hard work over the past year and more.

We are also grateful to [Erik Bray]({{site.baseurl}}/team/#bray_e),
who has volunteered to take over maintenance of
[our Windows installer]({{site.github_url}}/windows-installer).
As we have grown,
we have come to depend on our community to do more than just teach
(and yes, I just said "just").
If you would like to get involved in maintaining lessons,
mentoring new instructors,
or other non-teaching tasks,
please [give us a shout](mailto:{{site.contact}}).
