The first quarter of 2016 is almost over and so far the Mentoring Subcommittee
have been very quiet although we have continued hosting the post workshop debriefing
sessions and the pre-workshop helping session.

We have been quiet because we were busy with the Steering Committee election
and reorganization of the volunteer hours from our members since six of them
(Belinda Weaver, Bill Mills, Karin Lagesen, Kate Hertweck, Rayna M Harris and I)
were elected as Steering Committee members.
In addition to this some members had to temporarily reduce their volunteer hours
for various reasons but are now back to help us.

In the upcoming weeks you will hear more news from the Mentoring Subcommittee
but for now I want to ask you to welcome Christina Koch as the new chair of the
Subcommittee. Christina will replace me on this position and I can say that the
Subcommittee couldn't be in better hands. For those that don't know Christina,
she is one of our instructors working at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
last year she was one of the maintainers of our Shell lesson
and is now part of our Instructor Trainer team.

Christina is interested to hear from you about ideas for the mentoring committee.  
She may be asking for more feedback (and volunteers!) over the next few months, but for now, 
would appreciate receiving your thoughts via [this form][mentoring-form].
