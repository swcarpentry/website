I spend a good deal of my time trying to communicate with member
organizations about what it is that the Software Carpentry Foundation can do
to help them meet their own goals. It is part of my job to showcase to them
the return on investment that they'll see in various areas. The three areas in
which this is most apparent are impacts on skills transfer to learners who
attend workshops, the lesson material that is publicly available and built by
the community, and the capacity building that comes from mentoring instructors
who are thinking about impactful instruction in short workshops.  

In order to better arrange my ideas I decided to draw a Venn Diagram  with
circles for Lessons, Learners and Instructors. I've tried to use this diagram to
build my own mental model for how what we do in terms of core activities can
scale and grow. Through this process I've come to think of the structure in this
diagram as  podular (made of semi-autonomous pods), or a fractal element that
repeats at various community scales such as university, research network,
nation, or worldwide.

At each of our partner organizations we may have lessons, instructors and
learners with their own unique and local perspectives, working toward impactful
workshops that are appropriate for their own community. Internationally, we are
working toward spreading consensus lessons and ethos of using open source tools
for open and collaborative science to scientific communities via our workshops
while using evidence based teaching methods.

These workshops sit at the nexus of the diagram and showcase, in a
focused event, what it is that we stand for. They reflect the impacts we would
like to have on changing how science is thought about in the context of
computation. The brands "Software Carpentry" and "Data Carpentry" reflect a
particular set of opinionated lessons arranged to have specific impacts on
learners. This is why we work so hard to make sure that a workshop called
"Software Carpentry" or "Data Carpentry" is being taught using our methods (the
instructor is "badged") and with instructors who have studied the
community-developed lessons.

Locally when we deliver a workshop we're working to bring together lessons,
learners, and instructors that can deliver impactful workshops. To be prepared
for this we strive to convince learners that spending two days with
these lessons and our instructors will be impactful and helpful to how they
work. When you put this all together, we're not just developing training and
delivering workshops, we as a community collectively own the lessons and are
advancing, testing and refining the evidence based teaching best practices that
we share with others and reinforce through our instructor training.

Outside of our core lessons and flagship workshops, you are strongly
encouraged to duplicate this structure and apply it at smaller scales toward
the specific needs of your own communities. This **is** how we grow and test
new  ideas and lessons. As you do this we want to know what you've learned, we
want to hear your success stories, we want to hear about your spectacular
failures. Overall, we want the Carpentries together to be a community where the
most broadly applicable lessons pertaining to the tools and best practices
needed to do modern research can come to be curated and improved together. At
the same time, we have [thriving global
conversations]({{site.mailing_lists}}/pipermail/discuss/)
about what gaps there are in our lessons, in our teaching methods, and how can
we address those gaps and have more impact on the practice of research supported
by computational tools.

One area that this diagram pointed out to me that we could do better at is
supporting and helping our learners in their self study. We do know from our
website analytics that browsing our lessons is one of the most popular
activities among website visitors. We also know, [through our instructor
survey]({{site.url}}/blog/2016/01/instructor-survey.html), that we have many
instructors that came to be a part of our community from self study of the
lessons online over the years. I would welcome ideas and efforts towards our
lessons and our community being more supportive of our learners who are
interested in self study. As it is, our lessons are mostly meant to be
instructor notes, but if we could find ways to make them more useful for self
study, I think that would be fantastic.

What are your thoughts and ideas on this diagram, are there any ways to
enhance it or improve it that you see? It has really helped me to organize
a jumble of ideas I've been dancing around in conversations with partners
over the past several months.
