A global team worked to update the Library Carpentry curriculum and lesson material at
this year’s [Mozilla Science Lab Global sprint](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/events/global-sprint-2016).

The work kicked off in Brisbane, where Clinton Roy, Natasha Simons and I worked with Carmi Cronje in Sydney to start the ball rolling.
Matthias Liffers came online in Perth two hours later. At 5.30 pm our time, we handed over to teams in South Africa, the Netherlands,
and the UK, led by Anelda can der Walt, Mateusz Kuzak, and James Baker respectively.

James, with his colleagues Owen Stephens and Daniel van Strien, were the original developers of the Library Carpentry material.
During the sprint, James developed a new regex quiz, while Owen helped update and migrate the OpenRefine material.

Canadian and US teams (from Caltech and UCSD) began work as the sun moved around the globe. 

Cam Macdonell seemed to be up all hours and was a key driver for getting the material migrated into new templates.

The original four-module lesson (covering shell, regular expressions, git, and OpenRefine) has now become seven, 
with a new SQL module (based on the Data Carpentry lesson) being added, along with others for persistent 
identifiers and computational thinking. 

Draft learning objectives were created for most of the main lessons which are linked 
from [here](https://github.com/data-lessons/librarycarpentry).

Material for five modules was migrated to the new Data Carpentry lesson template. Library-based datasets were 
swapped in to make the lessons more relevant to librarians. 

During the sprint, all the Library Carpentry action was co-ordinated through a 
[dedicated chat room](https://gitter.im/weaverbel/LibraryCarpentry) and via daily evening Hangouts 
where the day’s work was reported, before being handed over to the incoming team, rather like a baton being passed in a relay race. 

This was a really great experience, and I thank all the amazing people who dedicated their time to the project, and who 
have volunteered as maintainers into the future. there is still a lot of work to be done, but we made huge progress.
