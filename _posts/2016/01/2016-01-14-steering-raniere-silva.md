My name is Raniere Gaia Costa da Silva
and I'm standing for re-election to Software Carpentry Steering Committee
because working on the Steering Committee in 2016 was fun
and a great way to meet some of the amazing members of Software Carpentry community.

## Background

I have a B.Sc. in Apply Mathematics from the University of Campinas, Brazil,
and in the last year I worked as a freelancer software developer
using most of the time Python and Javascript.
This year I will move to the UK for work on the University of Manchester
and collaborate with The Software Sustainability Institute.

## Previous Involvement

I discovered Software Carpentry in 2013 (I wish that I did it early)
and contacted Greg asking to be in the next round of instructor training,
what happened in 2013's Fall, because I was trying to do Software Carpentry like workshops in Brazil.

In 2014 I sent some pull requests to the lessons
(mostly to Shell, Git and Python),
annoyed Greg because we use Python 2 and not Python 3,
helped over-engineering our <del>crazy</del> lesson template,
and delivery the first half dozen of Software Carpentry in Brazil.

Last year,
because of Steering Committee activities
I significant drop the number of pull request sent to the lessons
(something that I missed very much).
On the Steering Committee
my biggest contribution was leading the Mentoring Subcommittee
that host the post workshop debriefing sessions
and the help & instructor retreat that happened last Fall.

## Plans for 2016

In 2016,
independent of the result of the Steering Committee election,
I want to focus on the assessment of achievements that our students had after
attend our workshops because this is a important piece to Software Carpentry
sustainability and expansion.

I will not leave the Mentoring Subcommittee
because it is one of the ways to get data for assessments
but I hope to pass the leadership of it to one of our current members.

If I was elected I want be secretary of 2016 Steering Committee
because although we did a good job with the minutes of the meetings
I believe that we could do it a lot better.

A few extra things that I want to do but don't plan to spend many hours are:

-   run our first workshop in Portugal (or any other country that speaks Portuguese),
-   collaborate to workshops in Latin America continue to be offered, and
-   translate the lessons to Portuguese (or any other language).

Sometimes I write in [my blog](http://blog.rgaiacs.com/) about
book that I read, cities that I visited, things that I tried to hack
and Software Carpentry workshops that I taught.

Some of my projects are on [GitHub](http://github.com/rgaiacs).
Most of them are **old** and abandoned. =(
