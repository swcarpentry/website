<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
A new version of "Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned" is
[now available on F1000](http://f1000research.com/articles/3-62/v2).
We think it's an interesting complement to
the [instructor survey]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2016/01/instructor-survey.html),
and we hope you enjoy them both.
