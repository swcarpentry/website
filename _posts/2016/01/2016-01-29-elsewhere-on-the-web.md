<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
Our instructors teach a lot more than just Software Carpentry.
For example,
[Christie Bahlai]({{site.baseurl}}/team/#bahlai_christie) has started teaching a course on
"Open Science and Reproducible Research".
You can [follow the course blog](https://osrrcourse.wordpress.com/)
or check out the materials in [the course repository](https://github.com/cbahlai/OSRR_course)---contributions
from the community are very welcome.
The course already includes lots of interesting ideas,
and there's more to come.

Elsewhere,
[Tiffany Timbers]({{site.basurl}}/team/#timbers_tiffany) is organizing several half-day workshops at Simon Fraser University
as part of Titus Brown's
[Data Intensive Biology training program](http://dib-training.readthedocs.org/en/pub/).
These workshops will be hands on and supported by several TA's in addition to the instructor.
All are welcome to participate, regardless of discipline or training level---please feel free to distribute these events widely.
And if you cannot attend locally because of geography,
please note that several of them are being streamed on YouTube:
