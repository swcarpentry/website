Back in the fall we surveyed our then 450-strong instructor community for
feedback on what being an instructor has done for them.

To recap, we asked the following questions:

* How did you get interested in doing Software Carpentry/Data Carpentry?
* How do you use the skills you teach in Software Carpentry/Data Carpentry in your daily work?
* What is the benefit (personally and/or professionally) to you in being involved with the Software Carpentry/Data Carpentry Community?
* What examples do you have of how the Software Carpentry/Data Carpentry Community have benefited others (students, labs, university groups)?
* What suggestions do you have for improvement?

There is a ton of great information in this report that can be useful for building momentum for Software and Data Carpentry instructor training and workshops at your own institution. It is clear that we have a **very** active and driven pool of instructors. This is a large part of what made me so excited and passionate about the community when I first became an instructor. I hope that we can learn from each other and broaden the impacts that this community is having around the world!

I hope you take some time to read through what your peers have had to say about the rewards of being an instructor. Please do take action and help us to put some of the great suggestions in the report into our various processes.

The resulting report is available [here (PDF)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_SI17G7h2s2b1B0TUdYRl9rR1k/view)
