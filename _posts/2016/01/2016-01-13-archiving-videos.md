<h2>This post originally appeared on the [Software Carpentry website](https://software-carpentry.org/)</h2>
People have been asking for videos of our lessons more and more frequently over the past few months,
so we have begun archiving links on
[the lessons page]({{site.baseurl}}/lessons/#video).
If you have more,
please send them our way
(either as a pull request against the lessons page in
[our website's GitHub repo](https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/blob/gh-pages/pages/lessons.html)
or [by email](mailto:{{site.contact}}).
