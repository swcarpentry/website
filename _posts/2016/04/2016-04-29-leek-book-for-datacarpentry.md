Thanks to the efforts of Len Epp at Leanpub and Tracy Teal at Data Carpentry,
50% of the royalties from the book *[How to Be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist/)*
will be donated to Data Carpentry.
The book is pay what you want with a suggested price of $10.
I am very excited to help support the efforts of Data Carpentry
since I believe data science education is a fundamental need in the modern scientific era.

*About the book:*
The face of academia is changing.
It is no longer sufficient to just publish or perish;
we are now in an era where Twitter, Github, Figshare, and Alt Metrics are regular parts of the scientific workflow.
Here I give high level advice about which tools to use, how to use them, and what to look out for.
This book is appropriate for scientists at all levels who want to stay on top of the current technological developments affecting modern scientific careers.
The book is based in part on the author's popular guides including guides for

* [Reviewing papers](https://github.com/jtleek/reviews)
* [Reading papers](https://github.com/jtleek/readingpapers)
* [Career planning](https://github.com/jtleek/careerplanning)
* [Giving talks](https://github.com/jtleek/talkguide)

The book is probably most suited to graduate students and postdocs in the sciences,
but may be of interest to others who want to adapt their scientific process to use modern tools.
