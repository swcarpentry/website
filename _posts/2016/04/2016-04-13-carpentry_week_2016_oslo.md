In March 14-18 2016 we organised the first [Carpentry
week](http://www.ub.uio.no/english/about/news-and-events/events/ureal/2016/160314carpentryweek.html) at
the University of Oslo. After a mini-Seminar on Open Data Skills, there
was a Software Carpentry workshop, two Data Carpentry workshops and a
workshop on Reproducible Science as well as a ‘beta’ Library Carpentry
workshop.

The Software and Data Carpentry effort at the University of Oslo, aka
‘Carpentry@UiO’, really started in 2012 when I invited Software
Carpentry to give a workshop at the university. The then director, Greg
Wilson, came himself and gave an inspirational workshop – recruiting
Karin Lagesen and I to become workshop instructors in the process. Karin
and I graduated from instructor training spring 2013 and have been
giving a couple of workshops in Oslo and elsewhere.

In the fall of 2014 we partnered with the UiO
Science Library
([Realfagsbiblioteket](http://www.ub.uio.no/om/organisasjon/ureal/ureal/))
with the goal of giving regular workshops and to recruit more people as
helpers and instructors. Before Carpentry Week, we have held 4
workshops, and 10 helpers and instructors became involved.

In connection with the 4th birthday of the Science Library, we together
came up with the plan to organize a [mini-workshop on Open Data
Skills](http://www.ub.uio.no/english/about/news-and-events/events/ureal/2016/160314dataskills.html)
(the video recording is
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=609bPxVfrT0)), followed by four
days with five workshops with a total of 90 participants. We were very
fortunate to have three international instructors coming all the way to
Oslo for these events: [Tracy Teal](http://idyll.org/~tracyt/),
executive director Data Carpentry; [Leah
Wasser](http://www.neonscience.org/about/staff/leah-wasser), supervising
scientist at The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON); and
[Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org), assistant professor at UC Davis.
Tracy, Leah and Titus, thanks for coming!

The workshops we offered were:

-   A Software Carpentry workshop teaching automating tasks with the
    Unix shell, collaborative code development through version control
    with git and github, and modular code design with python, with 10
    participants; this workshop was taught by Halfdan Rydbeck, Hugues
    Fontenelle, Arvind Sundaram and Axel Rosén
-   A Data Carpentry workshop for GeoSciences and others, focussing on
    spatio-temporal data, the use of shell for data exploration and data
    analysis and visualization using R, with 10 participants, taught by
    Leah Wasser, Michael Heeremans and Anne Fouilloux
-   A Data Carpentry workshop for Biosciences/Genomics teaching about
    metadata, use of the shell and cloud computing, and data analysis
    and visualisation using R, with 29 participants, taught by Tracy
    Teal, Carrie Andrew and Lex Nederbragt
-   A ‘beta’ version of a Library Carpentry workshop teaching about
    version control with Git and GitHub, tech jargon, working with plain
    text formats using Sublime Text, APIs, regular expressions, use of
    the shell, and data cleaning using OpenRefine with 28 participants,
    taught by Leon du Toit, Elin Stangeland, Live Kvale, Kyrre T.
    Låberg, Ahmed Abdi Mohammed, Mari Lundevall, Stian Lågstad and Dan
    Michael O. Heggø.
-   A one-day workshop teaching technologies such as make, Jupyter
    Notebooks, Docker, myBinder and RMarkdown/Knitr for making
    computational analysis more reproducible, with 13 participants,
    taught by Titus Brown and Tracy Teal

Carpentry Week gave a real push to the effort at UiO, generating a lot
of attention and allowing us to recruit several new helpers and people
interested in becoming instructors. At the Mini-Seminar, we proudly
announced that the University of Oslo joins the Software Carpentry
Foundation as an affiliate. Affiliate status enables us to strengthen
the effort at UiO, help grow the Foundation, and gives us easier access
to instructor training.

For me personally, the Carpentry Week was a fantastic experience. It was
very satisfying to see so many undergraduate and graduate students,
postdocs and other staff coming to the workshops – we clearly are
addressing a need for this kind of skills training. This was the first
time I experienced – and instructed at – a Data Carpentry workshop. As I
suspected, many researchers I interact with need the kind of training
these workshops offer – perhaps even more so than what Software
Carpentry offers. I don’t have many possibilities to teach with
experienced instructors not from UiO, so witnessing both Tracy Teal and
Titus Brown gave me a excellent opportunity to reflect (positively) on
my own teaching.

Finally, Software and Data Carpentry attract a fantastically open, warm
and welcome community of scientists and students, and we see the same
happening at UiO. Instructors and helpers are a great bunch of people to
work with!

The Carpentry@UiO initiative wants to thank the Science Library, whose
excellent organizational skills made putting together so many workshops
a breeze. The Library provided the indispensable organizing efforts that
such events require, as well as coffee and tea, fruit during the
workshops, and lunch for everyone participating each day. Live Rasmussen
and coworkers, you are fantastic! Let’s do this again next year…
