We're very pleased to announce the newest ([v1.5.1][]) release of [AMY][], our
workshop management tool.  This release is special because:

1. it contains more bugfixes than new features
2. we had a number of submissions from prospective
   [Google Summer of Code 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC)
   students.

GSoC students that submitted fixes or new features to AMY:

* [Shubham Singh][] added "Notes" field to instructor profile update form
* [Nikhil Verma][] found and fixed "List duplicates" page error when no
  duplicates existed
* [Shubham Singh][] added new tag "hackaton"
* [Chris Medrela][] found and fixed 404 page for revisions that didn't exist

Additionally [Nikhil Verma][] is working on getting certificates to generate
from within [AMY][], but this will probably land in [v1.5.2][].

Apart from GSoC students we've had a number of contributions from our very
own Maneesha Sane, Greg Wilson and Piotr Banaszkiewicz.

If you want to read more about changes introduced in [v1.5.1][], here's
