<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
I recently created videos for installing the software needed for most Software Carpentry workshops.
Links for these videos are now added to the lessons template for a workshop and listed below.

### Windows:
- [Git Bash and SWC installer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=339AEqk9c-8)  
- [Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQ0mzZ8UvA)  
- [R/Rstudio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PjTAylwoU)  

### Mac:
- [Shell, git and nano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY)  
- [Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcSAln46u9U)  
- [R/Rstudio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ly3kyxwEg)  

So far, we only have Windows and Mac videos.
If anyone wants to make Linux versions, I'm happy to answer any questions.
Or if you want to make the recordings and not the voiceover, I'm willing to narrate.

## Acknowledgments
The idea for installation videos was proposed by UW-Madison instructors and helpers during one of our local meetings. I recorded all the Windows videos, Christina Koch recorded all the Mac videos, and I did narration for all of them.
