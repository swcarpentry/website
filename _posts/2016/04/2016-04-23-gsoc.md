Thanks to a lot of hard work from some members of our community and members of
others open source scientific projects we are happy to welcome the students and
mentors that will participate on Google Summer of Code this year under NumFOCUS
umbrela.

This is the second year that NumFOCUS participate on Google Summer of Code and they have more than the double of slots from last year. Selecting the students was very difficult due the high quality of the proposals that are archived on [GitHub](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/tree/master/2016/proposals).

As last year, we suggested that possible students use GitHub to communicate with possible mentors and use pull requests if they want to have feedback on their drafts. After the application deadline we talked with some students and they mention be afraid to work in the open with their proposal at the begin but they received valuables suggestions what is an reasonable trade-off.

In terms of Software and Data Carpentry communities, Piotr Banaszkiewicz, our student last year, will be one of our mentors this year aside Ethan While, Henry Senyondo, Greg Wilson and I.
