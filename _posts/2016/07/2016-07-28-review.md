##General
* University of Otago held a [three day workshop]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2016/07/otago-workshop.html) which allowed attendees to also have some "productive" hours afterwards.

* Universtiy of Auckland held a succesfull two day [Genomics R]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2016/07/auckland-R-workshop.html) workshop despite some random challenges.
* Universtiy of Auckland also held a Python-based [winter bootcamp]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2016/07/auckland-winter-bootcamp.html) and received overwhelmingly positive feedback.
