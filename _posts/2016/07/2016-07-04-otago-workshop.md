A three day Software Carpentry workshop was held at the [University of Otago](http://www.otago.ac.nz/)
from June 29 - July 1.  The instructors for the course were Mik Black, Nick Burns,
Murray Cadzow, David Eyers, Tanya Flynn and Tom Kelly, with Anthony Shaw and Riku Takei
 providing additional assistance as helpers.  This was Tanya’s and Nick’s first time
 teaching at a SWC workshop, so it was great to add them to our Otago carpentry team.

For the three day format, we reduced the number of contact hours per day so that we ran from
9am to 2:30pm - this gave our attendees with family commitments the ability to experience
the whole workshop, and also meant that attendees with other work demands were still able
to clock up some “productive hours” after the workshop finished each day.  To better fit
the three day format we also adjusted the order of our material a little - rather than
teaching Unix shell, R and Git as discrete modules, we split the Shell and Git lessons into
two, and gave an intro to these topics on day 1, then spent all of day 2 on R, then returned to Shell and Git on day 3, finishing with R functions at the very end.  The goal was to show
how all of the topics could link together as part of a single workflow - we didn’t quite get it right (next time we’ll use a single example that runs through all the modules), but it’s
certainly given us “food for thought” for our next Software Carpentry offering. The feedback
was on the overall very positive and there certainly is an improvement over our previous
workshops, in particular with regards to pace, delivery and dealing with technical issues.

We had a surplus of helpers so Tom became more involved in the "sharing" part working on the
training materials, including a `git` lesson on branches and  several pull requests to the Software Carpentry lessons
repositories. It would be interesting so see whether others have had issues with the
material we where did. While it was valuable to have extra helpers avaiable at times
(with technical issues springing up across the room), we gave the learners room to
interact with each other during the exercises.

Favourite moments of Software Carpentry:

 * Sitting with a learner helping her to find the errors in her code, and hearing her
exclaim (something like): "Yes, it works!  Now I mustn’t delete that.  Wait, I’ll back it
up with Git!”  We’ll call that a victory for SWC.  :)
 * Scanning the Eventbrite bar codes with my iPhone.  So fun!
 * Having one of our learners adhere so closely to the “bring your own computer” requirement
that she arrived with her 27 inch iMac desktop each day (admittedly she only had to carry
it downstairs to the venue, but it demonstrated wonderful enthusiasm!)
 * Having great gender ratios: 13 of our 19 learners were female, which is exciting given
 the traditional male-skew that we see in many computational fields.

At the end of our final session we promoted ResBaz 2017 (it’s never too early to start
spreading the word!), and our Otago Mozilla Study Group - many of our learners expressed
interest in joining our regular informal training sessions, so hopefully our local community
will continue to grow.
