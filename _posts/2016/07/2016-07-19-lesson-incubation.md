The [Data Carpentry]({{site.dc_url}}) and [Software Carpentry]({{site.url}}) Steering Committees
recently approved [a process for supporting [the incubation of new lessons]({{site.baseurl}}/lessons/incubation/).
The goal is to provide a clear path for creating new material and getting it into the hands of people who can teach it
while taking into account the resources we have available and the need to maintain lessons as well as create them.
If you would like to build something substantial for either of the Carpentries,
we'd enjoy hearing from you.
