Software Carpentry has accomplished an amazing amount over the past six and a half years,
but a new opportunity has come up for me here in Toronto,
and after a great deal of thought,
I've decided to pursue it.
At the end of January 2017,
I will be taking a position as a Computer Science Education Lead at Shopify,
where I will help with their CS education partnerships.
I'm excited to have a chance to work for change locally,
but also look forward to continuing to be involved in the Carpentries as a volunteer,
and to many more discussions of teaching, open science, and how awful Git truly is.

It has been a privilege working with you all:
watching you turn a handful of lessons into a global organization empowering tens of thousands of researchers
has been the best experience of my career.
Thank you for everything.
