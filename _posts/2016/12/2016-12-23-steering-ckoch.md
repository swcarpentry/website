As you can see, Software Carpentry has meant a lot to me over the past 
3-4 years.  I've received so much from the community, and would now like 
to give back in a new way - as a member of the steering committee.  

As a member of the steering committee, I would primarily aim to:

* work together with my fellow committee-members, the Software Carpentry leadership, 
and the community at large to build a shared vision and direction 
for Software Carpentry. 
* create policies and structures that enable community members to realize 
this vision for Software Carpentry, providing both the freedom to try new things, 
and the necessary oversight to guide their efforts. 

Personally, some of my visions and goals for Software Carpentry include: 

* Provide clear avenues for supporters and community members to connect 
with the Software Carpentry organization and with each other.
* Maintain a pool of high-quality instructors and provide opportunities for 
instructors to share knowledge and grow in their teaching skills.
* Initiate opportunities for community members to learn more about topics 
like accessibility, diversity, and discrimination.  

However, I am most interested to hear what other members of the community 
value about Software Carpentry and what their goals would be for 
the organization and its members.  

If you read the above timeline carefully, you'll see that I went from my very 
first Python script and git repository to teaching other people in 
under a year.  I'd be applying that 
same "get-started" motivation to my work on the steering committee - learning
the ropes as quickly as possible so that I can direct my energy 
back towards the community right away.  

If any of this sounds interesting to you, I encourage you to vote for me, or 
even better, to join me and stand for the steering committee yourself!  

P.S. For those who are interested in knowing a little more about me, I work as 
a [Research Computing Facilitator](http://wid.wisc.edu/profile/christina-koch/) for 
the [Center For High Throughput Computing](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/) at the
[University of Wisconsin - Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/).  I love to read, 
have recently gotten into knitting, and this winter, have tried my hand 
at [curling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling) for the first time.  You 
can say hi or follow me on Twitter at
