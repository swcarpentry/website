We're looking for someone with IT skills, and interests in teaching and
physics, to work with us at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at
UCL (University College London).

This is a system manager job with an emphasis on supporting our
teaching, and will involve a wide range of responsibilities, including
managing a Linux cluster and interfacing PCs to lab equipment as well as
providing first-line support for the university Windows environment.

The application deadline is Monday 2nd January 2017.
Applicants must already have the right to work in the UK.

## Duties and Responsibilities

A system manager is required to support Teaching and Learning in the
Department, and to provide some support to administrative support
staff. The balance is likely to be approximately 75% support for
teaching and learning, and 25% other support.

The Department has over 180 desktop computers in teaching labs. Most
of these are installed with the standard UCL Windows Desktop
environment, also available to students in other cluster rooms across
the University, and permit each student to record their experimental
work, analyse data, and engage in e-learning activities while in the
lab.  Additionally, we have around 30 individual PCs interfacing with
lab equipment. We also have a Linux cluster available for student use:
this currently has 19 PCs running Scientific Linux, supported by
rack-mounted servers in a separate machine room, but this is likely to
expand.

Programming is an important skill for any scientist, as well as for
many graduates who go on to work in other fields, and the computing
strand of our degree programmes is continually being reviewed and
updated. All Physics undergraduates learn programming in Python in
their first term and, depending on their choices, may learn
Mathematica, Matlab and Java in subsequent terms. Other courses, not
focussed specifically on programming, are also increasingly making use
of e-learning technology and some computing to carry out calculations
and aid understanding of scientific concepts. These courses all rely
on expert technical support to ensure that the relevant software is
installed and configured correctly.

Professional Services staff in the department use Windows PCs for a variety of
administrative tasks using locally installed software and services provided by UCL's central

## Key Requirements

 The successful applicant will have a proven ability to communicate
 and collaborate effectively with people of varying levels of
 technical knowledge, a demonstrable interest in and knowledge of
 physics and education, and excellent technical skills.


A deep knowledge of either Linux or Windows is required, along with
some experience of the other operating system and the willingness to
learn more. Applicants should have knowledge and experience of some of
the relevant technologies and tools. These include scientific
software, programming, e-learning systems, networking, and deployment
and configuration of computing hardware and services.
