[NumFOCUS](http://numfocus.org) (the organization which shelters
Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and several other open science
projects) is seeking to hire a full-time Projects Director to develop
and run a sustainability incubator program for NumFOCUS fiscally
sponsored open source projects. This is the first program of its kind,
with opportunity for enormous impact on the open source ecosystem. The
learnings from this program will be public, meaning it has the
potential to change how all open source projects are managed.  For
more information, please see [the job
posting](http://www.numfocus.org/blog/projects-director-job-posting).
