At the beginning of the summer, the Software Carpentry community joined forces
hold their [first ever Bug BBQ](http://swcarpentry.github.io/SWC-bug-bbq/). The
goal of this event was to squash as many bugs in our core lessons as possible
before we published and shipped the new version (2016.06) of the lessons. In
addition to the goal of getting a large amount of work done as quickly as
possible, we also aimed to use this event to engage and connect with our
world-wide community.

In anticipation of the event, we worked with the lesson maintainers to identify
and create specific milestones (issues and pull requests) that needed to be
resolved before we could publish the new lesson versions. On the day of the
event, our community worked hard to address these milestones, as well as to
proofread and bugtest the lessons. The Software Carpentry community embraced the
Bug BBQ event. We had [7 local sites spread across North America and Europe](https://github.com/swcarpentry/SWC-bug-bbq/blob/gh-pages/sites.geojson),
as well as many many people participating remotely across the globe. On the day
of the Bug BBQ alone, we observed a tremendous increase in the number of
submitted, merged and rejected pull requests per day compared to the previous
month. *Analysis courtesy of Bill Mills.*

The new version (2016.06) of the lessons have now been published, and details
about who contributed, and citations can be found [here](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/07/publishing-lessons.html). We
would like to thank all who contributed to the new versions of the lessons,
including those who participated before, during, and after the Bug BBQ. Our
materials are far from perfect, but we're very proud of what our community has
built.

The Bug BBQ was organized by the Software Carpentry Mentoring Sub-Committee. The
committee welcomes feedback and ideas for future Bug BBQs and other community
events. To get in touch with us, please email us at [mentoring@lists.software-carpentry.org](mentoring@lists.software-carpentry.org).
