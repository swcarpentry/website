PLOS has published a very useful set of articles called [Ten Simple Rules](http://collections.plos.org/ten-simple-rules)
that covers everything from effective statistical practice to winning a Nobel Prize.
I'm just as interested in what *not* to do and what mistakes to avoid,
so as part of our [instructor training course]({{site.training_url}}),
I'd like to put together a list of ten simple ways you can turn off your learners.
My first five are listed below;
if you'd like to add your own,
comments would be very welcome.

1. **Sneer at what they're doing right now**
   by saying things like, "OMG, you're using a spreadsheet!?"
   or, "If it isn't open, it isn't real science."
   Most scientists have been doing first-rate work for decades
   with their existing tools and practices;
   we may think we now have better ones,
   but telling them they've been wrong all these years
   isn't likely to make them listen.

2. **Trivialize their difficulties**
   by saying things like,
   "Oh, it's easy, you just fire up a VM on Amazon,
   install this variant of Debian,
   and rewrite your application in a pure functional language."
   This stuff is genuinely hard;
   talking as if it's not
   (and implying along the way that they must be stupid if they don't get it right away)
   isn't going to motivate them.

3. **Choose exciting technology.**
   "There's this cool new language I've been meaning to try..."
   should send the listener running:
   "new" usually means "rapidly changing" and "poorly documented",
   and while that may be fun for the 5-15% who like computing for its own sake,
   it's just an extra load for the majority.
   (See also Dan McKinley's talk [Choose Boring Technology](http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology-slides).)

4. **Insist on doing everything the right way.**
   You don't draw architectural blueprints before you paint a wall.
   Similarly,
   you don't need a cross-referenced design document (with appendices)
   for a twenty-line script that merges two bibliographies.

5. **Insist that people use a different operating system or package**
   because it's more convenient for you.
   They have to deal with the intrinsic cognitive load of the actual lesson material;
   don't also impose the extraneous load of new keyboard shortcuts and unfamiliar menus.
