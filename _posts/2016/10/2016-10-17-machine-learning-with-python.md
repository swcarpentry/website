A new book has recently been published that may be of interest to our community:

*[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030515.do)*

> Data driven approaches have taken over many empirical sciences and
> many business application.  Machine learning algorithms are one of the
> most important tools for extracting knowledge and making decision
> based on complex datasets.  This book takes a practical approach to
> machine learning, using Python and the scikit-learn library.  Starting
> from the basics, it explains how and when to use machine learning,
> discusses common methods and points out pitfalls for beginners.  Every
> method and example comes with code in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
> The book requires a basic understanding of the Python programming
> language and some familiarity with NumPy. Experience with matplotlib
> is helpful to gain a better understanding of the visualizations.

**Andreas MÃ¼ller** received his PhD in machine learning from the
University of Bonn.  After working on computer vision applications at
Amazon for a year, he joined the Center for Data Science at New York
University.  He is a maintainer of and core contributor to
scikit-learn, and has authored and contributed to several other widely
used machine learning packages.

**Sarah Guido** is a data scientist who has spent a lot of time working
in start-ups. She loves Python, machine learning, large quantities of
data, and the tech world. An accomplished conference speaker, Sarah
attended the University of Michigan for grad school and currently
resides in New York City.
