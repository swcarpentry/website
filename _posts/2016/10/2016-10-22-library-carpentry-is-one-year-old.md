The indefatigable [James Baker](https://twitter.com/j_w_baker)
recently wrote a blog post summarizing
[what's happened with Library Carpentry in the past year](https://cradledincaricature.com/2016/10/06/library-carpentry-where-we-are-nearly-1-year-on/).
It summarizes their lessons,
their workshops,
how Library Carpentry is managed,
and much more.
Announcements and initial discussion take place on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/weaverbel/LibraryCarpentry),
