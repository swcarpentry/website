Hans Petter Langtangen's books
*[Python Scripting for Computational Science](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Scripting-Computational-Science-Engineering/dp/3540739157/)*
and
*[A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Programming-Computational-Science-Engineering/dp/3642549586/)*
taught many of us how to do numerical computing with Python.
He passed away yesterday after a long struggle with cancer;
while I only had the privilege of meeting him in person twice,
we corresponded frequently during Software Carpentry's early years,
and he was always helpful, insightful, and enthusiastic.
He will be missed.
