A new online book has recently been published that may be of interest to our community:

*[Tidy Text Mining with R](http://tidytextmining.com/)*

This book provides resources and examples for people who want to use
tidy tools from the R ecosystem to approach natural language
processing tasks. The intended audience for this book includes people
who donâ€™t have extensive backgrounds in computational linguistics but
who need or want to analyze unstructured, text-heavy data. Using tidy
data principles can make text mining easier, more effective, and
consistent with tools already in wide use like dplyr, broom, and
ggplot2. Topics covered in the book include how to manipulate,
summarize, and visualize the characteristics of text, sentiment
analysis, tf-idf, and topic modeling.

The authors are still in the writing process and will be actively
developing and honing the book in the near future, but it already
contains many developed examples of using tidy data principles for
text analysis.
