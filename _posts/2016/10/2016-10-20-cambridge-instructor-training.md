Last month, Steve and Karin taught an instructor training
workshop at the University of Cambridge, sponsored by the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/).
The event was organized by Laurent Gatto,
a Software Sustainability Institute Fellow,
with help from Paul Judge and Gabriella Rustici
from the [University of Cambridge Bioinformatics Training facility](http://bioinfotraining.bio.cam.ac.uk/).
25 trainees from a diverse set of backgrounds spent two days getting to know each other and learning how to teach,
and several have already completed the checkout process.
You can read a full write-up
[on the SSI website](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-10-18-cambridge-instructor-training-19-20-september),
and we hope to be able to organize a repeat in the new year.
