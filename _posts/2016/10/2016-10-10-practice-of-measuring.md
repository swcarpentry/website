Dr. Beth Duckles,
who did [a valuable study of our instructor community]({{site.url}}/blog/2016/01/instructor-survey.html)
earlier this year,
gave a talk at the recent [Measuring the Impact of Workshops](https://www.software.ac.uk/miw/) workshop
titled "[The Practice of Measuring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d6UjiN7JxU)".
It's a very useful 50 minutes,
particularly for those of us who have backgrounds in the physical rather than social sciences.
