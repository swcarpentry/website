I co-taught one workshop this week,
had a day off,
then taught a second one on my own.
I didn't do well in either.
In the first,
I interrupted my co-instructor several times,
and shuffled the order of topics a couple of times without consulting her,
which wasn't respectful.
In the second&mdash;well, the feedback speaks for itself:

*   "I felt like I spent a lot of time listening to Greg tell stories when
    I might otherwise have been learning something in this workshop..."
*   "I was put off by Greg putting aside participantsâ€™ comments
    with an air of authority..."
*   "We started the day with a lesson to not be rude,
    but the instructor still made jokes about Javascript programmers,
    hipsters, etc."

I'm teaching another workshop next week.
I'd like to do better,
so I'm going to give myself three sets of three sticky notes.
Each time I stray from the schedule,
I'll take down one from the first set;
each time I tell a story,
I'll take one down from the second,
and each time I make a joke about anyone other than myself,
I'll take one down from the third.
This breaks my own rule about only trying to fix one thing at a time,
but I think these are all important enough to justify it.

I've been teaching off and on for almost thirty years.
It's not fun to realize that I still have lots of work to do,
but when it happens,
I tell myself the same thing as [Ben Orlin](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2016/10/19/what-i-tell-myself-after-a-bad-lesson/):

![I finish a lesson with a sigh. Disaster, almost from the start.]({{site.filesurl}}/2016/10/bad-lesson-01.jpg)

![I pitched it wrong.  Served up an undercooked activity.  Lost my temper.  Wound up snapping at the class, as if my sloppy plans were their secret doing.]({{site.filesurl}}/2016/10/bad-lesson-02.jpg)

![I've squandered an hour in each of 25 childhoods. Made a muddle of something that I care about. In short: done a bad job.]({{site.filesurl}}/2016/10/bad-lesson-03.jpg)

![And then I remember: the students I have yet to teach far outnumber the students I taught today.]({{site.filesurl}}/2016/10/bad-lesson-04.jpg)

![My growth, my learning - these matter too.  They are instrumental, because I am an instrument of my students' learning - and that means honing myself as I can.]({{site.filesurl}}/2016/10/bad-lesson-05.jpg)
