I taught or co-taught two instructor training workshops this week,
and made some pretty big mistakes in both.
I have another one coming up next week in which I'd like to do better,
so I'm going to give myself two sets of three sticky notes each day.
Each time I stray from the schedule,
I'll take down one from the first set;
each time I tell a story,
I'll take one down from the second.
It's no guarantee that I'll do better,
but *not* keeping track pretty much guarantees that I won't.

It's never fun to get critical feedback,
particularly on something you've been doing for so many years.
When it happens,
I tell myself the same thing as [Ben Orlin](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2016/10/19/what-i-tell-myself-after-a-bad-lesson/):

![I finish a lesson with a sigh. Disaster, almost from the start.]({{site.filesurl}}/2016/10/bad-lesson-01.jpg)

![I pitched it wrong.  Served up an undercooked activity.  Lost my temper.  Wound up snapping at the class, as if my sloppy plans were their secret doing.]({{site.filesurl}}/2016/10/bad-lesson-02.jpg)

![I've squandered an hour in each of 25 childhoods. Made a muddle of something that I care about. In short: done a bad job.]({{site.filesurl}}/2016/10/bad-lesson-03.jpg)

![And then I remember: the students I have yet to teach far outnumber the students I taught today.]({{site.filesurl}}/2016/10/bad-lesson-04.jpg)

![My growth, my learning - these matter too.  They are instrumental, because I am an instrument of my students' learning - and that means honing myself as I can.]({{site.filesurl}}/2016/10/bad-lesson-05.jpg)
