<p>A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/">short screencast</a> about <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596808303"><em>Making Software</em></a> is now up on Amazon. In each of the book's 30 chapters, leading researchers in software engineering explain what we actually know about code review, statistical prediction of software faults, how programmers communicate, whether using design patterns makes code better, the relative quality of open and closed source software, and a host of other topics. We hope you enjoy it.</p>
