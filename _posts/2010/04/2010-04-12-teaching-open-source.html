<p>Over at opensource.com, Red Hat's Greg DeKoenigsberg has a post about a new <a href="http://opensource.com/education/10/4/can-professors-teach-open-source">collaboratively-authored textbook on open source software</a> aimed squarely at undergrad courses. As M&aacute;ir&iacute;n Duffy points out in the first comment, it's very code-centric, but in my experience, that's the right approach: students won't be ready for discussion of design until they're proficient in coding [1]. I'm looking forward to borrowing lots from the book for <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>...</p>
<p>[1] This is, by the way, why I believe that attempts to teach  "computational thinking" without first teaching programming are doomed  to fail, but that's a rant for another time.</p>
