<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>I've just posted the slides for the first five episodes of the lecture on the Unix shell, covering:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction (or, why would anyone do this to themselves, really?)</li>
<li>Files and directories</li>
<li>Creating and deleting things</li>
<li>Pipes and filters</li>
<li>Permissions</li>
</ol>
<p>Minor things I have yet to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive letters on Windows, and how Cygwin hacks around them</li>
<li>The 'echo' command</li>
<li>(Briefly) Windows access control lists</li>
<li>Wildcards in filenames ('*' has been covered)</li>
</ul>
<p>Major things (the remaining three episodes):</p>
<ul>
<li>Environment variables, the export thereof, and how to configure things with '.bashrc'</li>
<li>Job control (Ctrl-Z, 'jobs', 'fg', and the 'ps' command)</li>
<li>Finding things with 'grep' and 'find'</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll do the other three slide decks tomorrow, then record and post the screencasts on Thursday and Friday. Please let me know if I've left out something absolutely essential...</p>
