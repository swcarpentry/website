<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>I will be teaching a version of Software Carpentry tailored for audio and music researchers at Queen Mary University in London from November 1st to 5th, 2010.  From the <a href="http://www.soundsoftware.ac.uk/autumnschool-2010-cfn">full announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are seeking nominations for a small number (up to 15) of UK-based  PhD students or early career researchers to attend the Autumn School.  The <a href="http://SoundSoftware.ac.uk">SoundSoftware.ac.uk</a> project will pay for reasonable travel and  accommodation costs for attendees.</p>
<p>Due to the level of interest we anticipate in this initial Autumn  School, and to obtain a balance of attendees from several UK research  groups, we are asking Research Groups to nominate potential attendees.  If you are a PhD student or researcher in a UK research group, please  contact your PhD supervisor, line manager, or Head of Group to ask them  to nominate you.</p></blockquote>
<p>I look forward to meeting everyone there!</p>
