<p>I have posted slides and transcripts for the next two lectures on testing, which cover unit testing with Nose, and testing interfaces instead of implementations. I was hoping to record the screencasts today, but setting up a new 64-bit desktop machine took longer than expected&mdash;hopefully they'll be up early next week, along with episodes on floating point and setting up fixtures. Comments, as always, would be greatly appreciated.</p>
