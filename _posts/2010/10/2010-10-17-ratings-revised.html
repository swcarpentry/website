<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>We asked, you answered: here are the latest results from our survey of what topics you'd most like us to cover, with links to the ones that have been posted. A few notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>N = 188 responses.</li>
<li>This is the first time data visualization has dropped out of the top 5.</li>
<li>It's also the first time that nerdish subjects like computational complexity and functional languages have placed anywhere near the top.</li>
<li>There's a noticeable mismatch between things we think people should know (like version control) and things people think they want (building desktop GUIs).</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusion: more data &ne; more insight.</p>
