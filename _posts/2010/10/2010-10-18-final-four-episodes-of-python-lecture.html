title: Final Four Episodes of Python Lecture
tags: ["Content"]
---
<p>The last four episodes of our lecture on Python are now available, covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>libraries,</li>
<li>tuples,</li>
<li>slicing, and</li>
<li>what <em>is</em> text, anyway?</li>
</ul>
<p>The last isn't really about Python, but it's something people trip over pretty quickly when they start using it.  Hope you find them useful...</p>
