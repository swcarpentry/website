<p>I've just finished teaching a four-day version of the course at the UK Met Office in Exeter. I think it went reasonably well, even if we did version control last instead of first :-). Here's the feedback the students gave me:</p>
<p><strong><em>Good</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most of what the instructor told us was probably true!</li>
<li>Liked the emphasis on the human aspects of software development</li>
<li>Liked the emphasis on evidence-based software engineering</li>
<li>Lots of details on how to <em>do</em> testing</li>
<li>Liked it when the instructor went off on tangents</li>
<li>Liked having pointers to more material</li>
<li>Instructor enthusiastic</li>
<li>Lots of stuff on course web site</li>
<li>Enjoyed learning a new language</li>
<li>Finally had someone explain <em>why</em> to make code readable</li>
<li>Nice mix of concepts and details</li>
<li>Modular course design allowed me to catch up when I got lost</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Bad</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No overall roadmap or guide</li>
<li>Some (many?) parts too fast</li>
<li>Didn't have access to the code the instructor was writing "live"</li>
<li>Instructor went off on too many tangents</li>
<li>The links the instructor mentioned aren't collected anywhere</li>
<li>There weren't any tea breaks on the first two days (tiring)</li>
<li>Need citations for claims that "studies show"</li>
<li>Some people left behind in some parts</li>
<li>Squeezing it into a week made some parts indigestible</li>
<li>Had to learn a new language</li>
<li>Don't know where to go next with Python</li>
<li>The first two days felt rushed</li>
<li>Some of the examples could have been better fits for this audience</li>
</ul>
