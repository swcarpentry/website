<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>Here are three instructional videos that I enjoyed watching:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/3261363">The Crisis of Credit Visualized</a></li>
<li><a href="http://prezi.com/aww2hjfyil0u/math-is-not-linear/">Math is Not Linear</a></li>
<li><a href="http://comment.rsablogs.org.uk/2010/10/14/rsa-animate-changing-education-paradigms/">Changing Education Paradigms</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What they have in common:</p>
<ol>
<li>They're informative.</li>
<li>They're fun to watch.</li>
<li>It must have taken a ton of work to create them.</li>
</ol>
<p>So my questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you like them more than what we're doing?</li>
<li>Are they "better enough" than what we're doing to justify the extra effort? We'd produce half as much material if we did this&mdash;would that be a good tradeoff?</li>
</ol>
<ol></ol>
