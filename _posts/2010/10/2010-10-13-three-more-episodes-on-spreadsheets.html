<p>We have uploaded episodes 5, 6, and 7 of Jason Montojo's lecture on spreadsheets, which cover conditionals, pivot tables, and the basics of charting. Comments would be very welcome&mdash;and if you'd like to contribute material as well, please get in touch (we're particularly looking for help with data visualization).</p>
