<p>Orchestral musicians make <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/jokes/viola.html">jokes about violas and viola players</a>. "What's a string quartet? A great violin player, a mediocre violin player, a bad violin player, and a cellist."  Or, "What's the difference between a viola and a trampoline? You take off your shoes to jump on a trampoline." But violas are as essential as they are unglamorous: hardly anyone plays them as a lead or solo instrument, but string quartets just don't sound right without that third voice.</p>
<p>I realized today that Python's sets [1] are sort of like the violas of programming. They come up quite naturally all over the place&mdash;just flip through any text on algorithms and count how often they're used. But they're rarely used <em>alone</em>, which makes it hard to come up with well-motivated examples when teaching them. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>"What vowels are present in this string?" Sure, but show me an application where that comes up: every one I can think of wants the <em>frequency</em> of the vowels, not just their presence or absence.</li>
<li>"Find out whether these photos have some tags in common." Sure, but (a) intersection and union are built in, so it's a one-liner, and (b) you'd almost certainly use a dictionary with photo IDs for keys, and sets of tags as values.</li>
<li>Anything with graphs: again, the nodes reachable from X are naturally stored as a set, but the graph as a whole will be a dictionary of nodes to reachable sets.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't worry about this too much in the Version 3 lecture on sets and dictionaries: I used a couple of completely abstract examples (including "which vowels"), and moved quickly into a discussion of how sets are stored and why their values have to be immutable. I'd like to do better in Version 4&mdash;I'd like every new tool or technique to be well motivated at the time of its introduction&mdash;but I'm damned if I can figure out how.</p>
