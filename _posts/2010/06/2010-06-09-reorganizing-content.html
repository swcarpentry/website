<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>In anticipation of posting more lecture content, we have reorganized the pages on this site.  If you look at the side menu, you'll see that "About/" and "Program Design/" now have sub-pages; we'll organize each lecture the same way to make it easier to follow along.</p>
<p>And if you're having trouble posting or viewing comments, please send us email&mdash; we <em>think</em> we've sorted it out, but hey, it's software...</p>
