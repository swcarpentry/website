<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>The second of today's sponsor interviews is with David Jackson from the UK Met Office.</p>
<p><em>Tell us a bit about your organization and its goals.</em></p>
<p>You can find out more about us at <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk">http://www.metoffice.gov.uk</a>, but broadly speaking, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>predict the weather for tomorrow, next week, next season and beyond;</li>
<li>are a significant contributor to the global understanding of climate change;</li>
<li>are leading researchers of weather science;</li>
<li>provide forecasts for sporting events such as Wimbledon and Open Golf;</li>
<li>stand shoulder to shoulder with Armed Forces around the world;</li>
<li>help keep roads open and planes flying;</li>
<li>inform the decisions and policies of businesses and governments across the world;</li>
<li>help the National Health Service provide preventative healthcare.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/">Our group</a> is focussed on research.</p>
<p><em>Tell us a bit about the software your group uses.</em></p>
<p>We have a lot of home-grown scientific models and related codes around weather and climate prediction.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems">Unified Model</a> is at the heart of this the code base.</li>
<li>Much of the compiled code is in FORTRAN.</li>
<li>We use Perl and shell scripting to bind things together, and also some Python.</li>
<li>Our MASS storage system is developed in JAVA.</li>
<li>We use IDL for data processing and R for statistical analysis. There is a lot of user code that sits on top of these base packages and a lot of bespoke development.</li>
<li>We use Subversion for version control and Trac for issue tracking.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Tell us a bit about what software your group develops.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The Unified model and related software is used internationally by a number of groups.</li>
<li>There is a whole range of software development from internationally supported software, like the UM to code scientists write for their own purposes, with other codes supported within the Met Office.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Who are you hoping Software Carpentry will help?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A scientist who does some software development for their own needs.</li>
<li>A scientific programmer who does not have a software engineering background.</li>
<li>In general, people who can code but would benefit from not-too-heavy software engineering principles.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How do you hope the course will help them?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The benefits of software engineering principles and disciples, such as testing and configuration management.</li>
<li>Good code structure practice.</li>
<li>How to make more code shareable and supportable.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How will you tell what impact the course has had?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Better disciple.</li>
<li>More shared code.</li>
<li>Better tested.</li>
<li>More confidence.</li>
</ul>
