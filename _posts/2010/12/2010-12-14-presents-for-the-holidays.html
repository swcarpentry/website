<p>Some of the best presents I have ever received have been recommendations: "Oh, you'd like this author," or, "You really should listen to this album."  So, in the holiday spirit, please take a moment and share (in the comments) some pointers to  computational resources that you think deserve to be better known.  To get the ball rolling, I'm having fun playing with <a href="http://www.ruffus.org.uk/">Ruffus</a>, a simple Python library for constructing pipelined workflows.  I'd also recommend Jonathan Weiner's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679763902/"><em>Time, Love, Memory: A Great Biologist and His Quest for the Origins of Behavior</em></a>. It's ostensibly a biography of Seymour Benzer (who spent his entire career exploring how genes determine behavior), but it's actually the best description I've ever read of how a successful long-lived research program actually works.</p>
