<p>The <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/solstitial">solstitial</a> holiday is approaching fast, but with a bit of luck, we should be able to get one more lecture up on the web before it arrives. Topics we could tackle are:</p>
<ol>
<li>a survey of empirical results in software engineering,</li>
<li>building desktop GUIs,</li>
<li>handling XML, or</li>
<li>object-oriented programming.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Web programming isn't on the list because it will take more time than we have.) If you have a preference, please cast your vote in a comment on this post...</p>
