<p>I'm working up another essay on software design, and would like to ask readers of this blog how <em>they</em> handle something that comes up when simulating interacting agents. If your program models the behavior of a flock of birds, it probably looks something like this:</p>
<pre><span style="color: #800080;"># create birds</span>
birds = []
<strong>for</strong> i <strong>in</strong> range(num_birds):
  new_bird = Bird(...parameters...)
  birds.append(new_bird)

<span style="color: #800080;"># simulate movement</span>
<strong>for</strong> t <strong>in</strong> range(num_timesteps):
  <strong>for</strong> b <strong>in</strong> birds:
    b.move(birds) <span style="color: #800080;"># need access to other birds to calculate forces</span></pre>
<p>There's a flaw in this&mdash;or at least, something questionable. By the time you are moving the last bird for time <em>t</em>, every other bird is effectively at time <em>t+1</em>. There are many solutions, the simplest of which is to calculate each bird's new position in one loop, then update the bird in another:</p>
<pre><span style="color: #800080;"># simulate movement</span>
<strong>for</strong> t <strong>in</strong> range(num_timesteps):
  new_pos = []
  <strong>for</strong> b <strong>in</strong> birds:
    p = b.next_position(birds) <span style="color: #800080;"># doesn't move the bird</span>
    new_pos.append(p)
  <strong>for</strong> (b, p) <strong>in</strong> zip(birds, temp):
    b.set_position(p)</pre>
<p>(If you haven't run into it, the built-in function <code>zip</code> takes two or more lists, and produces tuples of corresponding elements. For example, <code>zip('abc', [1, 2, 3])</code> produces <code>('a', 1)</code>, <code>('b', 2)</code>, and <code>('c', 3)</code>.)</p>
<p>So far so good&mdash;but what if the things we're simulating can produce offspring, die, or eat one another? Offspring are relatively simple to handle: we just put them in a temporary list (or set), then append them to the main list after everything else has been moved.</p>
<p>Removing creatures that have died is a bit trickier, because modifying a list as we're looping over it may cause us to skip elements (we delete the element at location <em>i</em>, then advance our loop counter to <em>i+1</em>, and voila: the item that was at location <em>i+1</em> but has been bumped down to location <em>i</em> is never seen in the loop). We can handle that either by "stuttering" the loop index:</p>
<pre>i = 0
new_pos = []
<strong>while</strong> i &lt; len(birds):
  state, p = birds[i].move(birds)
  <strong>if</strong> state == ALIVE:
    i += 1
    new_pos.append(p)
  <strong>else</strong>:
    <strong>del</strong> birds[i]</pre>
<p>or by moving creatures that <em>haven't</em> died into another list, and swapping at the end of the loop:</p>
<pre>temp = []
<strong>for</strong> b <strong>in</strong> birds:
  state, p = b.move(birds)
  <strong>if</strong> state == ALIVE:
    temp.append((b, p))
birds = []
<strong>for</strong> (b, p) <strong>in</strong> temp:
  b.set_position(p)
  birds.append(b)</pre>
<p>I think the second is less fragile&mdash;modifying structures as I'm looping over them always gives me the shivers&mdash;but either will do the job.</p>
<p>But now comes the hard case. What happens if birds can eat each other? If bird <em>i</em> eats bird <em>j</em>, for <em>i&lt;j</em>, it's no different from bird <em>j</em> dying. But if bird <em>j</em> eats bird <em>i</em>, we have a problem, because bird <em>i</em> is already in the list of survivors. Do we search for it and delete it (in which case, the stuttering solution above is definitely <em>not</em> the one we want, because the indexing logic becomes even more fragile)? Or... or what? Set a "but actually dead" flag in the bird's record in the temporary list, and not move it back into the bird list after all in the second loop? What would <em>you</em> do, and why?</p>
