<p><a href="http://hackerwithin.org/thw/plugin_wiki/page/SCBCAnnouncement">Registration is now open</a> for a three-day Software Carpentry bootcamp Jan 12-14, 2011, at the University of Wisconsin &mdash; Madison, organized by the folks at The Hacker Within. I'll be speaking on the first morning, and hanging out the rest of the time trying to learn as much as I can. Look forward to seeing you there!</p>
