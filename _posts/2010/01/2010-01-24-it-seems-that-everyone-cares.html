<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a> isn't primarily a science site, but even they are now worried about <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/01/keeping-computers-from-ending-sciences-reproducibility.ars">reproducibility in computational science</a>.  I think it no longer matters how important this "crisis" actually is&mdash;sooner or later, major funding agencies are going to mandate adoption of something like the <a href="http://openprovenance.org/">Open Provenance Model</a>. Problem is, given the current skill set of the average scientist, that will almost certainly translate into burden without benefit.</p>
