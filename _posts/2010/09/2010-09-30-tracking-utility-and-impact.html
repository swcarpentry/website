<p>Mark Guzdial recently posted some interesting (and for us, slightly depressing) <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2010/09/23/few-users-study-in-mit-open-courseware/">statistics about MIT Open Courseware</a>. Long story short, it looks like that flagship effort isn't as widely used as many of us had hoped or believed.  I can't find equivalent stats for the <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> (a scrappy "agile" alternative to MOC that has been getting a lot of attention in the geek community), but even if I could, those numbers probably wouldn't answer my real question: who is this reaching, and what impact is it having? As Guzdial points out, asking users to self-report is subject to large sampling bias, as is googling for links back to lectures. Our sponsors want to know who's using our stuff, and whether it's helping them: how do we answer those questions?</p>
