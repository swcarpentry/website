<p>Via <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2010/03/software-carpentry-version-4-is-a-go.html">a comment from Scooter Morris</a>: the University of California San Francisco is offering a "short course" variant of Software Carpentry under the course codes <a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Outreach/bmi280/">BMI-280/BMI-219</a>. Their slides are online in S5 format, and include lots of useful stuff that aren't in the stock version.  If you know of other offerings, please send pointers!</p>
