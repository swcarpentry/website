<p>I had planned to leave it out, but <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2010/08/another-update-on-what-you-want.html">your votes</a> count: the first eight screencasts of our lecture on the Unix shell are now online. Topics covered are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction (4:09)</li>
<li>Files and Directories (9:55)</li>
<li>Creating and Deleting (6:23)</li>
<li>Pipes and Filters (9:11)</li>
<li>Permissions (10:54)</li>
<li>Finding Things (9:22)</li>
<li>Job Control (5:37)</li>
<li>Variables (6:49)</li>
</ol>
<p>I've already got a list of changes to make (thanks to feedback from IsaacG2&mdash;my apologies, but I didn't see your comments until after I'd recorded), but I hope this will be a good start. And for those who are interested, the eight episodes together took 36.5 hours to write, revise, record, and edit, for 62:20 of screen time.  That's better than the 50:1 ratio I was clocking in June, but I need to squeeze it further if I'm going to finish everything on time.</p>
