<p>I'm pleased to announce that we'll be running Software Carpentry online October-December 2010 for up to 40 graduate students and researchers at Ontario universities.  Please see the Fall 2010 page for details (as we get them), or <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact us</a> if you would like to enrol. The course is free, but non-credit.</p>
