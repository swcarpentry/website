<p>No, we don't have a list&mdash;not yet&mdash;but we'd like to. What short, readable papers or articles do you think every scientist doing computational work should read at some point in their career (preferably <em>early</em> in their career)?  Paul Dubois' 2005 article in <em>Computing in Science and Engineering</em> on <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1069590.1069683">maintaining correctness in scientific programs</a> is a favorite of mine; so is Evan Robinson's summary of research on <a href="http://www.igda.org/why-crunch-modes-doesnt-work-six-lessons">the effects of overwork on productivity</a>. (Actually, I think <em>everyone</em> should read Robinson's article, not just computational scientists...) What else should be on the list? To qualify, entries must be short (up to a few pages long), well written, of broad general interest, and have something important to say that's relevant to our target audience. Suggestions in the comments, please...</p>
