<p>Dr. Roscoe Bartlett (Sandia National Laboratory), Dr. Jeffrey Carver (University of Alabama), and Dr. Lorin Hochstein (University of Southern California) are conducting a survey of software development practices among computational scientists. This survey seeks to understand current software development practices and identify areas of need. The goal is to produce a report on the status of scientific software development which can serve as the basis for future work in this area. The survey should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>The survey can be found <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dGZwR1BfQ2NiNGh6SWt4ZjBCTnFoVmc6MQ#gid=0">here</a>, and has been approved by The University of Alabama IRB board.</p>
