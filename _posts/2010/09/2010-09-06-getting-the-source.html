<h2>This post originally appeared on the [Software Carpentry website](https://software-carpentry.org/)</h2>
<p>In response to several queries: if you'd like to get the source for both the Version 3 material (the old static HTML pages) and the new Version 4 stuff, they're both in our Subversion repository at http://software-carpentry.org/swc. The whole world should have read permission; please let us know if you run into any problems.</p>
<p>And if you're minded to contribute material, we'd welcome help: please contact us by <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">email</a> to talk about what you could do.</p>
