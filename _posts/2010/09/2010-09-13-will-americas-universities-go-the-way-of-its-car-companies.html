<p>Two days before I flew south to speak at <a href="http://www.msu.edu/">Michigan State University</a>, I read <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/16941775">an article in <em>The Economist</em></a> that asked the question in the title of this post. As it says (quoting <em>US News &amp; World Report</em>), "If colleges were  businesses, they would be ripe for hostile takeovers, complete with  serious cost-cutting and painful reorganisations." I agree with many of their points: the universities I have worked at (six of them, on three continents) all suffered from the sedimentary buildup of red tape that you'd expect of a large organization that hasn't faced real competitive pressure in living memory, and struggled to achieve either of their core goals of fostering research and passing knowledge on. To quote a friend who's still in the system, "We're here to do research, they pay us to teach, we spend our time on administration."</p>
<p>It's tempting to look to technology for a solution, but I don't think webcasting or interactive game-style tutorials will have any real impact on students unless they're supported by large-scale institutional change. To continue with the auto analogy, GM didn't fail because its machinery wasn't as good as Toyota's; it failed because its business model and thought processes weren't as good. That's why I think that the most interesting part of what we're doing isn't the screencasts we're making, but the peer support and just-in-time tutoring we're going to start putting on top of them next month. If we can do for students from anywhere what <a href="http://hackerwithin.org/thw/">The Hacker Within</a> has done at the <a href="http://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin</a>, then we'll be doing more than help grad students in science and engineering program better: we'll be helping, in a small way, to figure out what a 21st Century education ought to look like.</p>
