<p>One of the many advantages of online delivery of course material is that it allows us to present content in several ways, tailored to different audiences. For example, some people want to understand how sets are stored in hashtables; others just want to know that you cannot put a list in a set, and should use a tuple instead. We now have episodes catering to both: the longer and more detailed one posted last week, and a shorter and less detailed one posted today. We'd welcome feedback: is this confusing, helpful, or (as is so often the case) a bit of both?</p>
