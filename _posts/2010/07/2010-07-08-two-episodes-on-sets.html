<p>I've just posted an introduction to sets in Python, and a brief look at how they're implemented (which you need to know in order to understand why you can't put a list in a set). The second of these has more theory in it than most of our episodes; I'd be grateful for feedback from non-computer scientists about how much sense it makes.</p>
