<p>We have created <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/FM9YV9C">a survey</a> to find out which of the topics we're planning to cover are most important to you.  Please take three and a half minutes to fill it in; we'd be grateful as well if you could re-post the link, forward it to relevant mailing lists, etc.</p>
