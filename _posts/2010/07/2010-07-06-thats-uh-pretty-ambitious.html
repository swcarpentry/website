<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>The title of this post is taken from the reaction of the first person I showed this course schedule to. If we're really going to teach Software Carpentry in one university term (12-13 weeks), this is the pace we'll have to move at. What do you think? Is it crazy, or just nuts? And what, if anything, can be done about it?</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This course is designed for graduate students in science and engineering and their professional peers, which allows a faster pace than would otherwise be possible.</li>
<li>All problem sets are due one week after being assigned; their due dates aren't marked to avoid cluttering the table.  Based on past experience, each problem set is 4-6 hours of work.</li>
<li>There is no midterm or final examination.</li>
</ol>
