<p>A couple of people have asked why we're planning to host and serve the content we're developing instead of using a combination of YouTube and Google Code, or one of the emerging online education services such as <a href="http://learnhub.com/">LearnHub</a> or <a href="http://supercoolschool.com/">Supercool School</a>. Part of the answer is longevity: while standards like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharable_Content_Object_Reference_Model">SCORM</a> are supposed to make e-learning content portable between different systems, in reality there is still a large degree of vendor lock-in, particularly with hosted services, and we don't want to find that our content has gone off-line because someone hasn't survived a market downturn. Hostable learning management systems like <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> require more work to set up and administer, but are also more robust (at least for now).</p>
<p>For another part of the answer, have a look at Matt McKeon's visualization of <a href="http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy/">the evolution of privacy on Facebook</a>. How many of the "free" services that you use are making a living by selling information on your browsing patterns to marketing firms? The odds are that you don't know, and even if a service isn't doing it now, there's no guarantee they won't in future.</p>
