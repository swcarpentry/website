<p>Today I experimented with creating a few simple exercises for the material covered in the first screencast on databases.  The very last exercise includes a screencast that walks through the solution, and a potential pitfall along the way.  My apologies for the crappy audio and choppiness in a few places &mdash; I was using my laptop microphone, and I tried to edit out a few clicks and pops.</p>
<p>The exercises start easy and, well, stay easy, but this is the first lecture after all.  These exercises are aimed at giving students the chance to test out what they've learned, and help them decide if they are ready to move on.  What do you think?</p>
