<p>Setting up a new machine is never fun, but it's always interesting to compare what different people have in their toolkits. Here's what I have installed so far on the desktop machine I'll be using to do Software Carpentry course develpoment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Windows XP</em></strong> (yes, I still use XP)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> (a collection of Unix emulation tools for Windows)</li>
<li>Adobe PDF Reader</li>
<li><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> (for sound editing)</li>
<li><a href="http://miktex.org/">MikTeX</a> (an all-in-one LaTeX for Windows)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> (the open source clone of Photoshop)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a> (for chatting with my co-conspirators)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> (an open source vector drawing tool)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> (this course brought to you by Beethoven, John Coltrane, and a variety of 80s bands)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mathworks.com"><strong><em>MATLAB</em></strong></a> (I'm using R2008b)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mirekw.com/winfreeware/mwsnap.html">MWSnap</a> (for doing screen captures)</li>
<li><strong><em>Microsoft Office 2007</em></strong> (because most scientists who use anything, use Excel)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> (but I'll mostly use MS Office)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> 2.6 (because some of the packages I want don't exist for Python 3 yet)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> 2.11 (because after Python and MATLAB, R and Perl are our next target languages)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> (which gives me almost everything I want that isn't in the standard Python install)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> (for talking to collaborators)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> (for viewing video files)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html">yED</a> (for creating and editing simple bubble-and-arrow diagrams)</li>
</ul>
<p>What's missing (so far) are the science-specific tools that I'll be adding as needed for particular topics&mdash;I'll blog about those as I install them. What's <em>interesting</em> is how many of these tools are free (as in beer) and open (as in modifiable): I'll be blogging soon about the distinction, and why I think both are important to science, as well.</p>
