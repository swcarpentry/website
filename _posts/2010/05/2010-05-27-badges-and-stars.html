<p>The Open Notebook Science folks have developed <a href="http://onsclaims.wikispaces.com/">a set of badges</a> to help people label their work, ranging from "All Content &mdash; Immediate Release" to "Selected Content &mdash; Delayed Release". Like the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/downloads">badges for various Creative Commons licenses</a>, or Tim Berners-Lee's proposed <a href="http://www.elon.edu/e-web/predictions/futureweb2010/open_government.xhtml">five-star system for rating open data</a>, the biggest benefit of this kind of categorization is that it encourages people to think more clearly about what they are (or aren't) doing, and why.</p>
