<p>What kind of documentation do you use when you're programming? How useful do you find it? If have three minutes to fill in <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/whatdocsdoyoulove">a very short survey</a> on the topic (it's literally half a dozen questions), we'd be very grateful for your feedback.</p>
