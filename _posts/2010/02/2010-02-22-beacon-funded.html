<p>Congratulations to Titus Brown and others on the NSF's announcement that <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/feb-10/beacon-funded.html">it will fund the BEACON (Bio/computational Evolution in Action Consortium) Science and Technology Center</a>. BEACON "...BEACON is focused on studying the evolution of organization across multiple scales&mdash;from genomic and cellular, to multicellular, to inter-multicellular (a.k.a. social)&mdash;using techniques from experimental evolution, modeling, and digital life systems." Long story short, this means that Michigan State University and its partner institutions "...has money explicitly for supporting students doing really sexy interdisciplinary work combining computation and biology."</p>
