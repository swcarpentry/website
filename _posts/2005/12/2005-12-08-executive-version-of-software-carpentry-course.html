<p>I'll be teaching a shortened version of the Software Carpentry course at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Software Engineering in Toronto early next year.  For more information, or if you are interested in taking part, please see the IASSE's web site.  The dates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>January 16-20: one lecture per day, plus practical, with a quiz on Friday.</li>
<li>January 23-27: ditto.</li>
<li>February 6-10: two lectures and practical per day, with a short final exam on Friday afternoon.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've got a <em>lot</em> to do between now and then...</p>
