<p>As I've mentioned before, I'm running a workshop on <a href="http://www.aaas.org/meetings/Annual_Meeting/02_PE/PE_06_Career_Workshops.shtml#EssentialSoftware">"Essential Software Skills for Research Scientists"</a> at the <a href="http://www.aaas.org/meetings/Annual_Meeting/">Annual Meeting</a> of the <a href="http://www.aaas.org">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> on Friday, February 17, in St Louis.  I'm hoping to use the workshop to convince scientists, administrators, and policy makers that the things covered in the Software Carpentry course are essential to good science.  If you know someone who  ought to attend, please let them know, or pass them my contact information.</p>
