<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>The November 2006 issue of
<a href="http://cise.aip.org/"><em>Computing in Science and Engineering</em></a>
includes an article I wrote titled "Software
Carpentry: Getting Scientists to Write Better Code by making Them More
Productive".  It's available to subscribers only on the magazine's web
site, but they have kindly given me permission to post
it <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/files/bib/amsci-swc-2006.pdf">here</a>.
I think it's out too late to bring
November's stats up above October's, but I could be surprised.</p>
