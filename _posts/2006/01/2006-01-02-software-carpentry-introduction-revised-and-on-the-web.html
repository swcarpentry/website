<p>I have revised the Introduction to the Software Carpentry course. This was the easy one: no diagrams, no code fragments, no glossary entries; the rest will be harder.  I'd be <em>very</em> grateful for feedback, comments, and corrections.  (And yes, audio will follow, but not today&mdash;my nephews are playing Zombies downstairs, and juvenile shouts of, "Eat lead you undead scum!" aren't quite the background I have in mind.</p>
