<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>I have revised the second shell lecture and the lecture on version control for the <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> course, and added the necessary glossary definitions.  As always, comments are greatly appreciated.</p>
