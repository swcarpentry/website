<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>It used to be the introductory lecture on testing; now it's more of an introduction to quality assurance from a programmer's point of view.  It's changed even more than the style lecture; comments and corrections would be very welcome.  (And yes, I know, the diagrams are missing...)</p>
