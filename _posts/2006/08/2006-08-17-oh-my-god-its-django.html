<p><strong>Guido just pronounced: Django is <em>the</em> web framework</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Won't be part of the core, but will be as "standard" as PIL or NumPy</li>
<li>This was <em>not</em> what I expected the outcome of my talk would be, but hey, I'll take it ;-)</li>
<li>He hopes that Django and TurboGears will converge</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eric Jones: Enthought Tool Suite</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enthought does open source software and consulting for scientific computing with Python
<ul>
<li>One of the sponsors of this conference</li>
<li>Providing hosting for Software Carpentry</li>
<li>Walked through traits and other offerings</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chris Mueller: Synthetic Programming with Python</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A Python library for generating assembly code for the Power PC
<ul>
<li>Get rid of the many layers between Python and the hardware</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Great performance for great effort (up-front about that)</li>
<li>Q: How do you debug? A: insert an illegal instruction, back up a few bytes, single-step in GDB
<ul>
<li>Interested in multi-language debugger, but interested in a lot of other things as well</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><strong>Prabhu Ramachandran: 3D Visualization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Author of MayaVi, a better (more Pythonic) wrapper for <a href="http://www.vtk.org">VTK</a></li>
<li>Impressive &mdash; hides as much of the guff in complex 3D scientific visualization as it can</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Andrew Straw: Realtime Computing with Python</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Grand Unified Fly: a computational simulation of a fruit fly</li>
<li>Use Python for high-level stuff, and real-time for sub-millisecond control of motors, etc.</li>
<li>Program $20 microcontrollers with Python
<ul>
<li>E.g., Flydra is a multi-headed camera+FireWire system to track fly motion</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lightning Talks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mike Ressler: Prototyping Mid-Infrared Detector Data Processing Algorithms
<ul>
<li>Classic data crunching with NumPy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brian Granger: The State of IPython
<ul>
<li>Sales pitch</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Travis Oliphant: Array Interface BOF
<ul>
<li>Please for people to help put together PEP for arrays in Python</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Travis Vaught: Enstaller
<ul>
<li>Enhancements to Python Egg system (with GUI)</li>
<li>Worth tracking</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Michel Sanner: The Current State of Vision
<ul>
<li>Update on a visual builder for image processing pipelines</li>
<li>Very cool &mdash; but lots of overlap (it seems) with MayaVi</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Peter Wang: Quick Overview of Chaco
<ul>
<li>2D plotting library</li>
<li>Repeat of slides from yesterday's tutorial</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>William Stein: Software for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SAGE bundles together lots of other packages used for algebra and exact computation</li>
<li>Very particular about getting his whole half hour, despite the late hour ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alex Clemesha: Mathematica-like Plotting for SAGE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slow cruise through SAGE's graphics</li>
<li>As with web frameworks, Python has too many plotting packages for its own good</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Diane Trout: BioHub</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There's a <em>lot</em>of sequence data out there
<ul>
<li>And collection is accelerating rapidly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BioHub is a Python interface for large-scale genomic analysis
<ul>
<li>A database to link diverse annotation sources</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I didn't know that genes have version numbers... ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Greg Wilson: Software Carpentry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Last talk of the day &mdash; some locals had already headed home, but there were about 70 people present</li>
<li>Went well, but no one's offering to teach the course at their institution this fall</li>
<li>Slides available online</li>
</ul>
