<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>The glossary for the <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> course now defines 341 terms.  What may be more interesting (for those of you who have been following the course's development) is what I've taken out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code coverage and execution profiling: they really should be in the course, but don't fit into any of the existing lectures.</li>
<li>Date and time manipulation: it isn't part of software engineering per se, but like Unicode, floating-point roundoff, and a dozen other things, this is one of the subjects that everybody just ought to know about.  Again, it doesn't fit neatly into any of the existing lectures.</li>
<li>Cross-site scripting, and a few other security-related terms: the security lecture has been completely revamped.  It's much less ambitious, but (I hope) more informative.</li>
<li>Everything to do with UML: I've never used it outside of class, and have only ever worked with one person who did.  I therefore feel like a bit of a fraud including it in a course on practical software development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things that I want to add (eventually):</p>
<ul>
<li>Building desktop GUIs: yes, people still do this, and it's a great way to introduce some more OO concepts.  Now that there's a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932394621">book on wxPython</a>, maybe I'll finally do this.</li>
<li>User interface design, because I agree with Catherine Letondal (who has provided some very useful feedback): you shouldn't show someone how to build a GUI unless you show them how to build a good one.</li>
<li>Numerical programming, because I agree with <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tff/">Tom Fairgrieve</a>: people ought to need a license in order to use floating-point numbers.  I've actually written this one a couple of times, but (a) Python's Numeric module is still in flux, and (b) I don't want to dive into this unless I have something concrete to say about how you test floating-point code.</li>
<li>Extended examples: I'd like to write at least three or four mini-projects, each taking about an hour to describe, because I believe there are things you can only learn from examples.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, though, I'm going to concentrate on getting this release out the door...</p>
