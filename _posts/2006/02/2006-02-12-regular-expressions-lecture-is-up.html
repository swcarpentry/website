<p>The Software Carpentry lecture on regular expressions is now on the web.  It's a bit of a jump from the previous lecture on design, but given how shaky the latter was, I needed the cuddly warm blanket of working on something I'm sure I understand.  As always, comments and corrections to me, please.</p>
