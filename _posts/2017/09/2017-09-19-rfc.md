**We are now accepting comments on plans related to The Carpentries!**

A blog post [last week](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/merger.html) provided 
history and some context behind the planning still in progress for the eventual merger of 
Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry into a unified organization, tentatively called The 
Carpentries. An outline of the planned structure, roles, and responsibilities of The 
Carpentries is [now available](https://github.com/carpentries/2017Merger), and we request 
your feedback through a series of RFCs and related GitHub issues by October 6, 2017. 

Requests for Comment ([RFCs](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment), also 
called Requests for Public Comment) are a tool used by government groups and other 
organizations to solicit feedback on planned actions which may affect a broad community. 
So far we have attempted to keep you apprised of the planning process, but are interested 
in incorporating community input into the unified vision and plan presented in the following 
topics:

* RFC1 Organization and responsibilities of The Carpentries
* RFC2 Board of Directors
* RFC3 Membership Council (transition from current Software Carpentry Advisory Council)
* RFC4 Staff
* RCF5 Financial organisation
* RFC6 Subcommittees and task forces
* RFC7 Lesson Organizations

**Please head over to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpentries/2017Merger) 
and add your comments to relevant issues by October 6, 2017.**
