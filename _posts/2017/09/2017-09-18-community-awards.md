Is there a Software Carpentry community member you've noticed working 
extra hard to help our organization?  

If so, consider nominating this person for a Community Service Award!

The Community Service Award was inaugurated last year 
to recognize the crucial role of volunteer contributions
to the work of the Software Carpentry Foundation.  This award acknowledges 
individuals whose work, in the Steering Committee's opinion, significantly improves the 
Foundation's fulfillment of its mission and benefits the broader community. 

For full details, including how to nominate someone and a link to previous awardees,
see [this page](https://software-carpentry.org/scf/awards/). 

We especially welcome nominations in the next two months, as 
the Steering Committee will choose and 
announce awards in December.
