**Come share your experience and ideas about maintaining the Software Carpentry lessons**

We invite all members of the Software Carpentry community to 
participate in two upcoming events centered around maintaining 
our lessons: 

* Community Call this week on Thursday, September 21
* Task Force for the future of the Software Carpentry lesson organization

## Community Call

We will be discussing lesson maintenance on this week's community call, 
happening on Thursday.  
On the call, we'll gather community aspirations and concerns 
about the current lessons and their maintenance.  We also will 
ask for everyone's input on how we can best support and
recognize the valuable work of our maintainers and contributors.
See the [etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2017-09-20)
for times, agenda and to sign up.  Anyone from the community is welcome to join. 

## Task Force

As the plans for creating an [umbrella "Carpentries" organization](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/merger.html) 
continue, it's time to start thinking about what the Software Carpentry 
lesson organization will look like moving forward.  To that end, I'm organizing 
a [community task force](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/tree/master/TaskForces/2017-swc-lesson-org) to 
discuss the future of the Software Carpentry lessons and their 
oversight as we transition into a lesson organization 
of the future merged Carpentries.  

Have you wanted to be more involved with some of the decision-making around 
Software Carpentry lessons and the merger process?  This is an excellent way to do so!  It's 
only a two-month commitment, so this is also a great opportunity to  
take on some community leadership responsibility and see what it's like.  Sign up 
on [this etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/swc-lesson-org) to join us!
