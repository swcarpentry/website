#### My favorite tool is [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/).


OpenRefine all the way, baby! I'm the curator of [eagle-i](https://www.eagle-i.net), an RDF open access repository of stem cells, 
viruses, mice, core facilities, 
lab equipment and people. I use OpenRefine to facet by URI, 
by date, by label, to clean the data up, search for anomalies and export in csv, 
Excel or whatever format is needed for my purpose. 

I use OpenRefine's General Refine Expression Language functionality (GREL) to perform complex search and replace, 
to transform the data, to break up and combine strings. 

OpenRefine is the gateway to my deeper understanding of 
eagle-i, and has led the way to new uses of the data for assessment of facility use and resource discoverability.
