We are fortunate in the Carpentries to have many [member organizations](https://software-carpentry.org/scf/partners/) who support our work. However, if we are to continue reaching out to new disciplines and to build communities in under-served countries, we need a broader and more diverse membership base.  

What are the benefits of membership?

Members receive priority access to instructor training and guidance about capacity building at their organization. Once institutions have a pool of local instructors, they can readily run low-cost local workshops that teach foundational computational and data skills to their staff and students. Memberships give Software and Data Carpentry revenue to ensure the ongoing development and maintenance of the lessons demanded by research communities. We work to give your local instructors support, [ongoing mentorship](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion) and a forum for community lesson development. In addition, we have just launched round two of a [targeted mentorship program](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/mentoring-round-2/) to help new instructors develop their skills.

Want the Carpentries at your organization but not sure how to do that? To help answer any questions you might have, Software Carpentry Executive Director Jonah Duckles is hosting a series of [short webinars on membership](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/membership-webinars). We hope to see you there.

The next is at **noon UTC on Tuesday, 10 October**. (check [local time/date](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Carpentries+Membership+Webinar&iso=20171010T12&p1=%3A&ah=1).) 

If you can't make that one, the next will be held at **9 pm UTC on Tuesday 31 October**. [Check your local date and time  here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Carpentries+Membership+Webinar&iso=20171031T21&p1=%3A&ah=1).

Further webinars will be announced on the [webinars etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/membership-webinars).
