### My favorite tool for data analysis is [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 

I have used it for a few years now, I feel at ease when I need to work with tabular data. 
Using R makes my work enjoyable. I can clean my data in one place - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) - and then work with it creating new graphics. 
I also enjoy learning new things in R. Its constant development gives you the chance to learn a bit more every day. This is thanks to a 
huge collaborative community that supports you, with quick answers, with examples, and with new packages.
