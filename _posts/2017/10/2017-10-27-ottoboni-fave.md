#### My favorite tool is ... IPython.

[IPython](https://ipython.org/) is a Python interpreter with added features that make it an invaluable tool for interactive coding and data exploration. IPython is most commonly taught via the [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/), an interactive web-based tool for evaluating code, but IPython can be used on its own directly in the terminal as a replacement for the standard Python interpreter.

#### Why I like it

- You can run Unix commands directly in IPython. For instance, if you want to load a file from another directory, it is convenient to `cd` into the directory from within the IPython window.

- IPython has an extensive tab autocomplete for function names, function arguments, file paths, and object names.

- It comes equipped with "magic" commands: functions that assist in programming and that can be called with a single word starting with `%`. `%paste` takes whatever is on your clipboard and formats it nicely so IPython can read it -- useful for pasting in large blocks of code. `%timeit` runs time tests and `%lprun` runs line profiling automatically.

- The interpreter saves your command history across sessions. In case you close the window before you're done, you can fire IPython back up and search through the history.

- IPython makes it easy to test my code interactively, piece by piece.
