#### My favorite tool is ... IPython

IPython is a Python interpreter with added features that make it an invaluable tool for interactive coding and data exploration. 

#### Why I like it

- You can run Unix commands directly in IPython. For instance, if you want to load a file from another directory, it is convenient to `cd` into the directory from within the IPython window.

- IPython has an extensive tab autocomplete for function names, function arguments, file paths, and object names.

- It comes equipped with "magic" commands: functions that assist in programming and that can be called with a single word starting with `%`. `%paste` takes whatever is on your clipboard and formats it nicely so IPython can read it -- useful for pasting in large blocks of code. `%timeit` runs time tests and `%lprun` runs line profiling automatically.

- The interpreter saves your command history across sessions. In case you close the window before you're done, you can fire IPython back up and search through the history.

- IPython makes it easy to test my code interactively, piece by piece.
