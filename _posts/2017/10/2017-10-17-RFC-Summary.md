<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>

Thanks to everyone for sharing questions and comments on our recent 
[Request for Comments](https://github.com/carpentries/2017Merger) 
regarding the upcoming merger of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry. 
Now that the official response period for the RFCs has ended, the GitHub 
issues specific to the RFCs will be closed. We received comments from 
individuals across our community representing multiple stakeholders, including 
the Software Carpentry Advisory Council (representing member organizations) 
and the community at large (through the GitHub repository, private comments 
via the Google Form, and personal communication). Those of us working on the 
merger have been actively considering and discussing this valuable feedback 
and have been identifying areas requiring additional attention and clarification. 
We will be publishing blog posts over the next few weeks summarizing our thoughts 
and identifying future actions for each of the RFCs. You are welcome to continue 
communicating your questions or concerns to us through 
[new issues in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/carpentries/2017Merger/issues). 
Below we describe the context behind a few themes and issues emerging from the 
RFC discussions which may not be immediately apparent but have factored heavily 
into our approach.

* **Compromise.** This restructuring has involved months of discussion and planning 
involving the existing leadership for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry. 
While both groups share related visions and have begun to implement joint policies, 
the origins and governance of each group are quite different. As a result, our 
approach to  the merger is based on compromise and an understanding that no 
solution will be the perfect fit for everyone. 
* **Scalability.** Merging two organizations requires thinking carefully about 
the scalability of our current policies and processes. This includes the 
potential addition of other lesson organizations following the union of 
Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry, as well as continuing to reach more 
learners, train more instructors, and expand into new geographic areas. 
* **Staff.** As our organizations have grown, we have continued to hire staff 
to support the community in achieving our mission. With this increase in staff 
comes an obligation to these employees to provide job security and the ability 
to make longer-term plans related to their role in the organization. Moreover, 
the role of community governance (e.g., Board of Directors) can now shift focus 
from policy establishment/implementation to strategic planning.
* **Financial obligations.** Both organizations (and the future merged organization) 
are non-profit agencies supported by a fiscal sponsor. Additionally, support of 
our staff and other infrastructure comes largely from institutional memberships, 
for which we are obligated to provide associated services. 
* **Community involvement.** The role of the community in leadership and governance 
varies between Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry, in part because Software 
Carpentry is a more mature organization and in part due to differences in how 
the groups were formed. This reorganization is an opportunity to combine the best 
parts of each organizationâ€™s approach to leadership and governance. Specific decisions 
about governance have been based on previous experiences from both organizations, 
successful leadership models in other large volunteer projects, and the priorities 
described above.

All of these issues represent perspectives that we have considered during planning, 
and which we continue to weigh as we incorporate your feedback. We understand that this process
is resulting in incongruity with existing Software Carpentry governance procedures. 
We also recognize there are many decisions to be made that the original documents did 
not anticipate. Therefore, we are endeavoring to uphold the mindset of these guidelines 
and are using them as the foundation for the new organization's bylaws. If you have questions 
or concerns about this process, please feel free to contact 
[Kate Hertweck](mailto:k8hertweck@gmail.com), the Software Carpentry Steering Committee chair. 
Please watch for 
the upcoming summaries of feedback from the RFCs, as well as the call for nominations 
for the four elected members of the first Board of Directors of the merged organization.
