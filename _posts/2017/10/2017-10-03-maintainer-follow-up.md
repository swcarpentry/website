Our [September community call](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2017-09-20) on 
lesson maintenance brought up many good ideas around the lesson maintenance process 
for Software and Data Carpentry lessons.  If you weren't able to make the call, 
below is a summary of 
our discussion and potential avenues for growth.  

Our discussion focused around two major questions: what 
do the lesson maintainers do, and what are some of the reasons to 
be a lesson maintainer?  

## What do lesson maintainers do?

### Managing Issues and Pull Requests (PRs)

A big piece of a lesson maintainer's job is to respond to the issues 
and pull requests that are submitted to their lesson repository.  Depending 
on the extent of the suggested change, or the number of submissions, this 
process can be brief or time-consuming per week.  

There have been more and more contributions over the past few months as future 
Software and Data Carpentry instructors are required to submit a change or 
suggestion as part of their checkout process.  

> ## Room to grow: 
> 
> * General guidelines for the maintainers; how quickly to respond to PRs, 
> when to close them, etc. 
> * In instructor training, emphasize the equal importance of review, 
> not necessarily submitting new issues/PRs, as lesson contribution
> * Coordinate with maintainers when there may be "bursts" of work (lots of instructor 
> training, Bug BBQs)

### Curriculum Decisions and Feedback

An extension of managing a lesson's changes (via issues and pull requests) 
is making larger decisions about the lesson as a whole.  More significant 
issues can come up as the lesson grows 
(for example: in an R lesson, whether to emphasize tidyverse or base R), 
requiring a decision from the maintainers about which direction to go.  

In addition to these larger changes, there isn't always a good way to provide 
centralized feedback from the lessons after they're taught.  We have 
[discussion sessions](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion), but 
that information isn't always communicated back to the maintainers.  

> ## Room to grow: 
> 
> * Possibly provide some kind of "advisory" structure to the individual
> lesson maintainers for more big-picture decisions; currently being 
> tested by the Data Carpentry genomics maintainers
> * Communicate clear channels for providing feedback (both good and bad!) about the lessons.  
> * Have a process for working on larger changes (possibly separating the lessons 
> into a "stable" and "development" release, one version of this described 
> [here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-example/issues/126)).  

## What are the benefits of being a maintainer?

In our discussion, several benefits for being a maintainer arose: 

* Professional credit: 
    * We publish the lessons at least once a year and these can be listed 
    as publications on a CV.  Maintainers are equivalent to editors of a volume.  
    * Maintainership can be an item on a job or tenure application. 
* Improving your git skills, especially for managing a collaborative 
project.  These are skills that can translate to other areas, including software 
development and teaching.  
* Interacting with a wide variety of community members (via issues and pull requests)
* Being able to support something you believe in (teaching data or computing skills) by 
maintaining the lesson material.  
* Seeing different perspectives on a particular lesson; understanding why it is 
the way it is.  

> ## Room to grow: 
> 
> * Address some of the previous challenges in order to make maintaining lessons 
> more accessible. 
> * Create some standard descriptive wording for use in applications for jobs, 
tenure, and grants that maintainers can use to highlight their contributions.
> * Publicize our lesson publication information more widely. 

We hope to address some 
of the growth areas in the next few months; contact Erin Becker or Christina Koch 
if you have questions or feedback about the future of lesson maintenance.
