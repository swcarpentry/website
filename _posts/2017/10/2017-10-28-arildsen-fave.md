#### My favorite tool is ... the Jupyter Notebook.

One of my favourite tools is the [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/). I use it for teaching my students scientific 
computing with Python.

#### Why I like it: 

Using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) with the plugin [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE), 
I can create presentations including code cells that I can edit and execute live during the presentation 
to demonstrate the various aspects of Python that I introduce. It is a very good compromise between running scripts 
and typing in the command prompt on the projector screen vs. just showing static slides with code.
