A big thank you to everyone who has responded so far to the call for short posts about their favourite tools.

So far we have had [Paula Martinez](https://twitter.com/orchid00) on [R](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/my-fave-tool.html), with [Bianca Peterson](https://twitter.com/BinxiePeterson) [enthusiastically seconding](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/11/bianca-fave.html), Jeff Oliver sharing his love of [Git and GitHub](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/oliver-fave.html),
[Kellie Ottoboni](https://twitter.com/kellieotto) talking up [IPython](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/ottoboni-fave.html), and Thomas Arildsen on 
how the [Jupyter Notebook](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/arildsen-fave.html) facilitates his teaching. [Juliane Schneider](https://twitter.com/JulianeS) weighed in on the [wonders of OpenRefine](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/schneider-fave.html). Clifton Franklund likes [RStudio](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/11/franklund.html), while Francesco Montanari is a fan of [emacs](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/11/fm-fave-tool.html). 

[Rayna Harris](https://twitter.com/raynamharris) nominated [videoconferencing](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/11/harris-fave.html) as her most useful research tool, while [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson) talks up the [benefits of asking for help](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/11/asking-for-help.html). Robert Sare has posted on the benefits of [using rasterio](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/sare-favorite/) in earth sciences research.

Expect more posts as people contribute further favourites. Even if your tool has already been mentioned, we would still welcome a post about it,
as your use of the tool may be different.
