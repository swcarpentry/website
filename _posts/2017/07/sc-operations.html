You've hopefully seen [Belinda Weaver's post](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/06/weaver_cdl.html) 
announcing her hire as Community Development Lead for 
Software and Data Carpentry, which also mentioned her 
stepping down from the Steering Committee. This means we 
(the Steering Committee) will continue our term of service 
with only six members. We are confident in our ability to 
continue our operations as normal despite this change.

Thanks to Belinda for her service on the committee 
over the last year and a half, and we're looking forward 
to interacting with her in this new capacity.
