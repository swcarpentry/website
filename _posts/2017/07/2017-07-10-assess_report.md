We've begun to look at our pre- and post- workshop surveys and are sharing the draft reports to stimulate conversation about 
our workshops and their impacts on learners. For this first cut, we looked at our post-workshop survey data. 

From this survey data, we can see that learning to program can be quite intimidating for many learners. 
About 44.5% of Software Carpentry learners who responded to the post-workshop survey feel that at least one of the tools 
covered in the workshop they attended was either slightly or very intimidating to them before attending a workshop. 

Luckily for our learners, we have trained, enthusiastic, and considerate instructors who are great communicators. 
As a result, our learners are leaving Software Carpentry workshops with increased confidence and motivation to perform 
computing tasks like initializing a repo in Git and importing libraries in R or Python!
