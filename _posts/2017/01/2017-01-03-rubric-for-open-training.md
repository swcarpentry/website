The Software Carpentry Foundation's Steering Committee recently resolved
to run four open online instructor training sessions per year
in order to help support people whom we otherwise might not be able to reach.
Since there are likely to be many more applications than spaces,
we have developed a rubric for ranking requests for training.
**This applies only to people who are applying for spots in open training sessions:**
people who are receiving training through institutional partnership agreements
will continue to be nominated by their institution as before.

Note that as a condition of being trained,
people must:

1.  Abide by our code of conduct, which can be found
    at <http://software-carpentry.org/conduct/> and
    <http://datacarpentry.org/code-of-conduct/>.
2.  Complete three short tasks after the course in order to
    complete certification. The tasks are described at
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/>, and
    take a total of approximately 8-10 hours.
3.  Help teach a Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, or Library Carpentry
    workshop within 12 months of the course.
