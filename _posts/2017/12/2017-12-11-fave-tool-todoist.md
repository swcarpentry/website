My favorite tool is [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/), a task manager.

#### Why do I like it?

[Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/) is a cross-platform 'to-do' tool. I went through many different ones before settling on [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/) a few years ago
and I now use it to organize everything from my household chores, grocery shopping and gift ideas for family members to my
 many work projects and non-work projects (things I do that are work-related but not apart of my actual job).

Todoist can also work really well in a team. Right now at work I'm the only one who uses it, but my husband and I use it for
household communication about shopping and other tasks that need to be completed, we can assign each other tasks,
with time-triggered reminders and it really helps us stay on top of things.

Everyone works differently, and I hope you have a system that works well so you can get work done - I 
just wanted to share what has become a crucial part of my system.

#### How does the tool help me in my work?

The ability to have recurring tasks that I can easily input such as 'second Thursday of every month at 2pm' and the ability to add emails as tasks, with a link that opens up the email, have changed everything about the way I work. It allows me to clean out my inbox more effectively by assigning emails as tasks so I can answer them at the appropriate time, or have the email at hand for an important meeting in a few weeks, and it easily allows me to break down tasks into their component parts and keep track of them.

#### What do you wish someone had told you when you first started learning how to use this tool?

If you use [Gmail](https://gmail.com/), the integration with Todoist and Gmail is fantastic. Todoist also has integration with many other platforms, few of which I personally find useful but I have a few friends who think that is where the true power of Todoist lies.
