We are excited to announce that our website for **CarpentryCon 2018** is [live](http://www.carpentrycon.org/).

CarpentryCon 2018 will take place at [University College Dublin](http://www.ucd.ie/) from 30 May - 1 June, 2018, with the overarching theme 
of "Building Globally, Connecting Locally".

The three-day event will focus on professional development, community building and networking, as we aim to help 
skill up the next generation of research leaders through a combination of talks, workshops and breakout sessions. 

We are currently developing our program of speakers and workshops and hope to have a preliminary draft up on the website early in the new year.

In order to be able to keep registration costs low and to provide travel scholarships, we are seeking [sponsorship](http://www.carpentrycon.org/#portfolio) for CarpentryCon 2018.

Please feel free to share [this call for sponsorship](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSedlt68CXVmyVJ4DEI8P9nfAXhGYbTHA9YgFQYomXjzzZDJOg/viewform) widely.
Filling in the form does not commit organizations to anything beyond a conversation with us at this point - but we want to get those conversations started as soon as we can. Feel free
to ping us with suggestions of potential CarpentryCon 2018 sponsors by emailing `team` AT `carpentries.org` with the details. We will take it from there.

We will shortly be announcing a competition to design a promotional poster for the event. The winner will get **free registration** for CarpentryCon 2018.
