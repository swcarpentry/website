### Design a Promotional Poster for CarpentryCon 2018

The Carpentries are excited to announce our poster design competition where some lucky member of our community will win a **free** registration for [CarpentryCon 2018](http://www.carpentrycon.org/).

Are there any artists out there who could design a fantastic poster? If so, we want to see your design!

The winning designer will take home some fantastic Carpentries swag and gain free registration to CarpentryCon 2018. This includes registration for the conference only. It does not include travel to and from Dublin.  

#### Information for the Poster

CarpentryCon 2018 will take place in Dublin from 30 May - 1 June, 2018 at [University College Dublin](http://www.ucd.ie/) with the overarching theme of *Building Locally, Connecting Globally*.

The three-day event will focus on professional development, community building and networking, as we aim to help 
skill up the next generation of research leaders. Find out more from the [CarpentryCon 2018 website](http://www.carpentrycon.org/).
