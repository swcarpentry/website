Are you a new Software or Data Carpentry instructor?  Do you 
remember what it was like to be a new instructor?  Are you 
interested in improving your own teaching skills?  Do you want to connect 
with other instructors to share teaching ideas and experience?

The mentoring committee is a group of Software and Data Carpentry 
community members who organize initiatives to support instructors and 
**we're looking for new members**.

The mentoring committee meets once a month to discuss current activities and 
new ideas, and we help organize the weekly instructor discussion 
sessions hosted on [this etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion).  

We would love to expand our activities and for all of our activities 
to be a true community-driven and community-owned effort.  To make 
that happen, we need community members to join us!  Anyone can be 
involved -- the only criteria for membership is interest in how we can 
better support instructors and connect them with each other.  

Here are some ways to get involved: 

- Join the [mentoring mailing list](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/listinfo/mentoring) 
and/or attend next committee meeting (to be announced 
on [this etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/scf-mentoring) ). 
- Sign up to help with some of our main endeavors as described on 
[this page](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/subcommittees/mentoring/README.md).  
- If you have questions or suggestions about the mentoring committee, 
Christina Koch, outgoing committee chair, will be 
holding two informal FAQ sessions on Monday, March 13.  There is information 
about these on the [community calendar](https://software-carpentry.org/join/).  

We will also be selecting new positions in the committee next week -- if you'd like 
to vote (or stand for a position!) please get in touch.
