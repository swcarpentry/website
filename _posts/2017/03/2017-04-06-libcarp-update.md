There is lots of current Library Carpentry activity. Our big news is Library Carpentry won the British Library Labs award 
last year for innovation. The prize money has since been used to fund Library Carpentry workshops in the UK, 
with one in Sheffield just completed, and another upcoming in Taunton in May. 

Tim Dennis (UCSD) and I are running Software Carpentry instructor training for 30 librarians in Portland, OR, 
on 4-5 May (after csv,conf). I am then teaching Library Carpentry at MIT with Juliane Schneider (ex-UCSD, 
now with Harvard) on 15 May. We have helpers for that workshop from Boston University, Harvard and Yale.

We are running a Library Carpentry project again this year as part of the annual Mozilla Science Lab global sprint 
on 1-2 June. Our sign up etherpad is here: http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lc2017. 
So far, we have five sites committed to host people working on the sprint. 
People are also signing up to work remotely. 

We plan to work on SQL, Python, and web scraping lessons, rebuild our main page 
https://librarycarpentry.github.io, and to work out a way to record and track workshops better. 
We are also hoping to make Library Carpentry work for archivists. We are currently seeking 
feedback on what archivists want through this 
form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdc9RHNmgffnt9UtLfgIhS_MGUzh0wh-HQNX24wBz5c4mcf1g/viewform

More information on what we hope to tackle in the sprint is here:

So far, there have been about 15 Library Carpentry workshops since last yearâ€™s global sprint 
provided the impetus to build this community. The chat room is very 
active https://gitter.im/weaverbel/LibraryCarpentry and issues are constantly debated on GitHub. 
So far, Australia, Canada, the US, the Netherlands, the UK and South Africa are the main places 
for activity with New Zealand about to join the bandwagon. 
You can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LibCarpentry).

I have been invited by the Australian Society of Archivists to teach a Library Carpentry workshop 
as a tie-in to their annual conference in September. 

There is an upcoming workshop in South Africa in May, as well as plans for one in Ottawa a bit later on in the year. 
Hopefully there will be many more workshops in the US after the Portland instructor training mints 30 new instructors.
