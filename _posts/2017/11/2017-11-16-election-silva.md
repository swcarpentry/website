## Who am I?

My name is Raniere Silva.
I'm a Brazilian who currently lives in Manchester, UK,
where I work for the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) as a Community Officer and
help run the Institute’s [Fellowship Programme](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme).
The programme supports, among other activities, Carpentry workshops and this incredible community in the UK and beyond.

## Previous Involvement

I discovered Software Carpentry in 2013 after reading [this blog post](https://kaythaney.com/2013/06/14/announcing-the-mozilla-science-lab/),
being redirected to it by [this announcement](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/06/14/5992/).
Months later,
I [joined](http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2013/08/raniere-silva/) the 6th round of instructor training
along side Leszek Tarkowski, Michael Crusoe, Christina Koch, Mark Laufersweiler, Jonah Duckles and many other fabulous instructors
that I would only meet in person years later.

In 2014,
Fernando Mayer and I taught the first Software Carpentry workshop in Brazil and South America.
Later that year,
I had an opportunity to teach more Software Carpentry workshops in Brazil
with some international visitors: Alex Viana and Diego Barneche.

In [2015](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/01/scf-nomination-silva.html)
and
[2016](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/01/steering-raniere-silva.html)
I served 2 years at the Software Carpentry Steering Committee.
During that time,
I got especially involved with the mentoring activities,
now being lead by Marian Schmidt and Jamie Hadwin,
and pushed, in some form, the culture to have more than one session to help
volunteers to attend those independent of where they live and their personal commitments.

At the end of 2016,
I decided that was time to let others contribute to the project as members of the Steering Committee.
Kate Hertweck contacted me asking to help with the [lesson styles](https://github.com/swcarpentry/styles)
and most of my contributions to the project this year has been on the technical side.

Last week,
a friend delivered a Carpentry-inspired [workshop](https://github.com/SantosRAC/Python4BioDataBrazilianWorkshop) in Brazil
with a very positive feedback from the learners
and with requests for more similar events.
I was part of the Steering Committee of that workshop 
and it motivated me to apply to serve on the Steering Committee once again.

## Strengths

In the five years that I have been involved with the Carpentries,
the top 3 strengths of the Carpentry programme that I see are:

- The Carpentries’ name/brand,
  which is now recognised in many places worldwide.
- Transparency in all Carpentries’ activities,
  which is **very** hard to do but is always on the priority list.
- Community,
  that is passionate about the project
  and sharing their experiences and lessons learnt on a daily basis
  (for this week examples,
  see [this email](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss/2017-November/005585.html) and [this pull request](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/pull/438)).

## Weaknesses

Of course,
there is always room for improvement.
My top 3 items for us to be careful in the next 2 years is:

- Procedures,
  which need to be documented in a public place,
  as they are extremely important for the on-boarding process
  of new members of staff and community,
  but registering this knowledge takes time
  and in some cases slides down on our priority list.
- Communication,
  with the recent increase on numbers of our staff and volunteers
  we need to share the information with more people on various channels
  and still keep the number of emails, chat messages, meetings to a minimum,
  which is almost contradictory,
  we need to review our communication strategy.
- Diversity,
  we are very proud to be an inclusive community
  but, as [Greg Wilson mentioned here](http://third-bit.com/2017/11/05/for-everyone.html),
  we need to review our definitions
  and work to improve our inclusivity numbers.

## Two Years From Now

My metrics of success for the Carpentries in two years time are:

- At least 5 teams of staff located in at least the following time zones: UTC-8, UTC-5/UTC-3, UTC+1, UTC+8 and UTC+12 to secure easier reach and support for our worldwide community,
- 30% of partners from the United States and Canada, 30% from Europe, 30% from [Oceania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania), [East Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia) and [Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia) and 10% from other places. I would love to see more partners from South America, Africa and Asia but I know is unrealistic at the moment.
- Clarification of the ways in which volunteers could engage with the community. Although teaching workshops will continue to be the primary way to contribute followed by lesson development, volunteers can contribute in other forms but they need a clear path to do so.
- Conduct two studies, one in 2018 and another in 2019, about the retention rate of instructors and other volunteers without duplicating the work being done by the [Community Health Analytics Open Source Software (CHAOSS) project](https://chaoss.community/).
- A repeated CarpentryCon in 2019 (the [one for 2018](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/11/carpentrycon.html) is already planned).

## Conclusion

Thanks very much for your consideration to have me again as a member of the Steering Committee.
If I'm elected, I will put community, diversity and sustainability as top priorities.
