My favorite tool is [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). This integrated development environment (IDE) is really a force multiplier for data analysis and reporting.

RStudio provides an excellent interface to the R programming language (that much should be obvious). However, it is _much_ more than that. This application affords me easy workflows and shortcuts to interact with most of the other tools that I regularly use. These include:

- [GitHub](https://github.com)/git - for keeping all of my projects under version control and public-facing.
- make - for automating project builds and updates. 
- bash shell - for when the GUI just isn't cutting it.
- pandoc - to create beautiful reports as .pdf, .html, .docx, or .epub files.

Like Jupyter notebooks, RStudio fully supports literary programming and its own implementation of the markdown language. With packages like `blogdown` or `bookdown`, RStudio can easily be used to support the construction of static websites as well. 

Even better, I can also use RStudio to build presentation slides. I tend to use `revealjs`, but there are several other choices as well. When coupled with [Shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/), I can create free, reproducible, and interactive presentations that are available to anyone with a web browser.

I rely upon many different tools to get my work done, and all of them _can_ be used without the help of RStudio. But, when they work in concert with RStudio, my work gets done in a fraction of the time.
