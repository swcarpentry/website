My favorite tool: Videoconferencing

I know most of the blog posts so far in this series have been about the tools people use to enable them to conduct 
research. However, I feel quite strongly that the video conference systems that allow me to speak to other people 
have had the most profound impact on my development as a researcher and educator over the past three years. 

**[Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)** was the tool of choice for the [Software Carpentry Mentoring Subcommittee](https://software-carpentry.org/join/subcom/mentoring/) when we started hosting [post-workshop debriefing sessions](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/categories/#debriefing) in 2015. These virtual meetings gave instructors around the globe the opportunity to share their challenges and successes from recent workshops. Even though the discussion focus was on teaching, I always learned something new about the tools we teach - R, Python, SQL, UNIX, and Git/GitHub - through these discussions. 

**[BlueJeans](https://www.bluejeans.com/)** was the tool of choice for monthly meetings when I joined 
the [Software Carpentry Steering Committee](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/categories/#steering-committee) in 2016. 
As the most junior person on the Steering Committee, I felt that it was a great privilege to be a part of a global 
group of people trying to make the world a better place through best practices for computing and teaching. 
It wasn't always easy to pick a time of day that accommodated the timezones of all committee members, but we made it work. 

Finally, **[Zoom](https://zoom.us/)** has given me the capacity to spread Carpentry teaching practices to Latin 
America without leaving the comfort of my living room! Okay, of course, I would prefer to actually travel to teach in 
person, but that isn't always logistically or economically feasible. 
Additionally, I've been 
hosting [bi-lingual teaching demo sessions](https://twitter.com/datacarpentry/status/895380410091184128) where these 
instructors can practise teaching with live coding in their native language. 
It is a beautiful thing to listen to someone teach Python, R, UNIX, Git, or UNIX while speaking in a foreign language. 

In summary, those are just a few of the reasons why my favorite tools are video conferencing systems that connect me 
to like-minded people around the globe so that I can learn more about technology or practices that I can use in my 
research and teaching.
