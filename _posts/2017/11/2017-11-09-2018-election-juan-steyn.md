### 2018 Election: Juan Steyn

Hi! I'm Juan Steyn, currently employed at 
the [South African Centre for Digital Language Resources](http://humanities.nwu.ac.za/unit-languages-and-literature-sa-context/sadilar) 
as project manager. I'm an enabler at heart and I want to contribute and give back to the African and international 
Carpentry community. I especially want to help ensure that the core values of the Carpentries get transferred and 
integrated into how our workshops are conducted within new loci. Africa has **A LOT** of potential and I would like to 
play my part to enable and catalyze this potential into action.

#### My involvement with the Carpentries

The first Software Carpentry workshop I attended was organised by [Anelda van der Walt](https://twitter.com/aneldavdw) 
towards the end of 2015. This workshop provided me with a foundation to try new things when it came to 
programming and working with data. 

In 2016, I completed my instructor training and during my instructor checkout demo session the "penny dropped". 
During this session at 1 AM in the morning, it was an inspiring experience to see how people connecting 
from four different continents shared similar approaches and cared about the same thing. 
At that point, I started to appreciate the potential of the Carpentries' approach to enable and 
grow communities from the bottom up.  You do not need to be a tenured professor or a manager or 
anybody "important". You only need to be yourself and volunteer a bit of your time to make a 
difference and get a wealth of experience and life lessons in return.

During 2017, I got more involved with workshop organisation. I also joined the mentoring sub-committee 
and completed my Trainer training in September. To date, I've been involved with more than seven carpentry instructor 
events as instructor, host, helper, co-planner, mentor and trainer trainer. 

I'm also an advocate for the Carpentries approach, especially in growing computation capacity within the commons 
of Digital Humanities in Southern Africa as well as its potential to be a vehicle to introduce the workshop 
participant to digital scholarship and e-research.

I am also involved in the second round of Carpentry mentorship groups in order to contribute back 
to the community and further grow initiatives and support structures for Africa. 

#### Going forward

With the Carpentries expanding into new under-represented environments, cultures and languages, I believe it is 
important to emphasize the role of mentorship to transfer core values and approaches. 
In the African context, it is our experience that firstly a context-specific understanding 
is required to host successful workshops.  Secondly, it is important to share knowledge and 
especially the "ways of doing" through hands-on mentorship. I believe this is essential to 
successfully expand the Carpentries community further into new territories.

As [Bruce Becker](https://twitter.com/brusisceddu) recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/brusisceddu/status/926346054097952769):

"What did we learn from [@aneldavdw](https://twitter.com/aneldavdw) at [#UC2017](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23UC2017&src=typd)? Get up and do something. Your ripple might raise a tide."

So let's get up and start our ripples ...
