The Software Carpentry Steering Committee (SWC SC) announced 
[back in February](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/02/merger-discussion.html) 
that we were initiating discussion with Data Carpentry about potentially merging into a 
single organization. Members from the Software Carpentry Steering Committee and the Data 
Carpentry Board have been meeting regularly since then, identifying the advantages and 
logistical challenges associated with a restructured organization. More recently, we 
passed a motion approving the following structure: "A Carpentry umbrella organization 
and a set of Lesson Carpentries. The umbrella organization is primarily responsible for 
finances, administration, and facilitating policy. Each Lesson Carpentry is primarily 
responsible for lesson development and maintenance." 

This motion represents the first step towards a restructured Carpentries organization, 
with the respective community governance structures continuing to discuss and vote over 
the next few months. We will use the May Community Call to share our vision and goals with 
the broader community (that's you!). Mark your calendar for May 18 and sign up on the 
etherpad [the etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2017-05-18)!
