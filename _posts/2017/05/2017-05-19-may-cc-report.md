Thanks to those of you who attended the May Community Calls, the topic of which was 
restructuring of Software Carpentry (SWC) and Data Carpentry (DC) into a single unified 
(umbrella) organization, with SWC and DC continuing as lesson organizations within the 
umbrella.

As the Chair of the SWC Steering Committee, I am one of the representatives 
from each organization tasked with developing a plan of action for how the restructuring 
will proceed over the next ca. six months. I am gratified by how much our community cares 
about its future, and what we (as community) believe is important to target as we proceed 
in planning. The following items highlight major discussion points synthesized from both 
community calls, and a complete set of notes is available on the 
[etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2017-05-18).

* **Organizational members** represent major stakeholders in our community. Given a 
majority of organizations have signed joint memberships with SWC and DC, we expect the 
transition to a restructured organization will be smooth, with scheduling of workshops 
proceeding as normal. Representatives of each member organization currently comprise the 
SWC Advisory Council, and we are currently assessing how to maintain connections with 
member organizations in a restructured Carpentries.

* **Scalability** of a restructured organization is clearly an area of interest throughout 
our community. An umbrella organization represents an ability to not only combine the 
assets and advantages of both DC and SWC, but also allows for planning to expand 
operations into different disciplines, geographic areas, lesson modules etc. We are 
mindful of a need to balance opportunities for growth with continuing to provide 
high-quality workshops.

* **Local communities** are a cornerstone of scalable growth. Finding ways to bolster 
local and regional groups of learners and instructors represents an essential step in 
maintaining cohesiveness and identity as we continue to promote both the umbrella 
organization as well as individual lesson organizations.

* **Other lesson developers** besides DC and SWC (e.g., Library Carpentry) are already 
thinking about how they might fit in to the restructured umbrella organization. Given the 
restructured organization was designed specifically with this type of growth in mind, we 
are currently considering what mutual expectations and onboarding might look like in these 
cases.

* **Instructor Training** is currently in high demand throughout our community, and 
represents one of the major deliverables to our organizational members. Instructors 
certified for either DC or SWC are currently eligible to teach workshops for either group. 
When combined with the focus of instructor training on effective pedagogical practices, 
the restructuring process should not change how we train instructors.

Please note that we have only begun to lay out the basic framework for the restructured 
organization, and the points above serve to highlight areas of interest from the community 
calls. I'm excited about taking this feedback to the rest of the group involved in 
planning, and look forward to continued reporting on this process.
