After 6 months, I feel that I'm settling into my role as Software Carpentry Steering Committee Secretary. 
In an effort to improve communication and transparency between the Steering Committee and everyone else, 
I am commiting to writing or co-writing a montly blog post to keep you abreast on news from each meetings. 

Check out these new blog post summaries of the 
[in-person Software Carpentry Steering Committee Meeting](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/05/SteeringCommitteeRetreat.html) 
and of the [in-person SWC/DC merger group meeting](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/merger/). 

I also have resumed the process of **recoding all board resolutions** here with those from previous years: 
[https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/minutes/resolutions.md](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/minutes/resolutions.md)

For your reference, minutes are always archived here: [https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/tree/master/minutes](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/tree/master/minutes)
These can be a bit detailed or disorganized, so 
I've started to include a summary paragraph at the top the archived  to improve their readability. 

I've begun archiving the minutes for the Community Call meetings in this Carpentries GitHub repo: 
[https://github.com/carpentries/community-calls](https://github.com/carpentries/community-calls)

Please let me know if you have questions or concerns. Thanks!
