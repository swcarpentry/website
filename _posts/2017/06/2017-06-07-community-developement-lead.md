We're excited to announce Belinda Weaver has accepted our offer to become the
Community Development Lead. Belinda will join the Carpentries staff later this
month, please give her a warm and enthusiastic community welcome!

Many of you may already know of Belinda from her work all over the community as
a Software Carpentry Steering Committee Member,  the Mentorship Subcommittee,
the Trainers Subcommittee and a champion and leader of Library Carpentry. As
part of our bylaws Belinda will be stepping down from the Software Carpentry
Steering Committee on Friday June 16th and the Committee will finish the 2017
term with a membership of 6. For those  of you who don't know her yet, look for
her introductory blog post later today. In short, Belinda is a very active
community member and a delight to work with, weâ€™re incredibly excited to have
her contributing to our community full-time very soon!

We want to thank everyone who participated in the conversations about how we
created this staff position, the global search process, and helped with
community member interviews. It is always encouraging to see such a vibrant and
thoughtful community as we think carefully about how to grow our impact around
the world.

Belinda will officially begin in the new role on June 19th, 2017 and will be
joining us as a full-time staff member. You can reach her at:
