<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>Chris Lasher, who audited the Software Carpentry course long-distance last time around, has put together some screencasts to go with the first few lectures:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shell (<a href="http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=pQZLHo5Df">screencast</a>)</li>
<li>Subversion (<a href="http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=bfNi2X3Xg">screencast</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is very cool &mdash; if you have feedback, or want to praise him (hint, hint), please <a href="mailto:chris.lasher@gmail.com">drop him a line</a>.  I would also be interested in hearing how useful you find these &mdash; if there were twenty or thirty covering the whole course, would you actually watch them?  And would they help you understand the course material?</p>
