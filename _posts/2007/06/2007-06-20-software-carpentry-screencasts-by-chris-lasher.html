<p><a href="http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/?author=1364">Chris Lasher</a>, a grad student at <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">the University of Virginia</span> Virginia Tech (sorry, sorry), has posted some <a href="http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=bfNi2X3Xg">screencasts about version control</a> based on the Software Carpentry notes at <a href="http://www.showmedo.com">ShowMeDo.com</a>; a second series about using the shell should be up shortly.  It's just plain cool to see the material picked up and carried forward in ways I wouldn't even have thought of a couple of years ago.</p>
<p><em>Later</em>: now there's Bioscreencast.com, the <a href="http://www.jove.com/">Journal of Visual Experiments</a>, and others &mdash; the world moves on.</p>
