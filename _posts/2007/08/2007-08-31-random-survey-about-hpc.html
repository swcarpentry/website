<blockquote><p>The High Performance Computing (HPC) community is initiating a study to develop education and training pathways in order to enable scientists and engineers to advance the pace of discovery by taking advantage of high performance computing (HPC) and grids.</p>
<p>In order to inform our study, we invite you to complete a survey about your experiences.  We would like you to evaluate a list of categories of expertise according to how relevant they are for your work. We also would like to collect additional information about your training experiences.</p>
<p>The survey is very short and should only take a few minutes to complete.</p>
<p>Please go to the following link to complete the survey: <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=_2f7D2YUJfkH9Dua0PP_2f30_2fQ_3d_3d">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=_2f7D2YUJfkH9Dua0PP_2f30_2fQ_3d_3d</a>.</p>
<p>The survey will be open for input through September 11, 2007.</p>
<p>Your input is very valuable to us and will help us understand your training needs.</p>
<p>Thank you for your participation in this study!</p>

<p>The questions seemed pretty random/subject to broad interpretation, but I filled it in anyway&mdash;I'll be interested to see what if anything comes of it.</p>
