<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">www.scipy.org</a>, The SciPy 2007 Conference will be on August 16-17 this year; tutorials and sprints will run on the 14th, 15th, and 18th.  I won't be able to attend (new baby), but I'd like to organize a half-day or one-day session to update and extend the Software Carpentry notes.  Lots of modules need writing, both on Python-specific stuff and on general software engineering skills for scientists and engineers.  I'd particularly like to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lecture or two on NumPy (used to have one, it fell behind Travis Oliphant's coding, and it's probably now the biggest gap in the lectures)</li>
<li>A whole lecture on the subprocess module, job control, and remote execution</li>
<li>A second lecture on security</li>
<li>Some screencasts on Python IDEs (Wing 101, IDLE, Eclipse, and Komodo)</li>
<li>A lecture on connecting to C and Fortran</li>
<li>A lecture on design patterns</li>
<li>A lecture on professional ethics and responsibilities</li>
<li>And stuff on requirements, traceability, data lineage, and, oh, what else do <em>you</em> want?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested, please let me know...</p>
