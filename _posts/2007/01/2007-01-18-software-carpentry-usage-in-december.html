<p>Visits to the Software Carpentry site were down quite a bit in December; I had expected a drop because of the holiday, but not this large.  On the bright side, 47 students have signed up for the course at <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">U of T</a> this term; about 1/3 are from Computer Science, while the rest span Civil Engineering, Ecology, Physics, Ecology, and the life sciences.</p>
