The Carpentries are excited to announce that Valerie Aurora will be one of four keynote speakers at this May's [CarpentryCon](http://www.carpentrycon.org/) in Dublin.

[Valerie](http://valerieaurora.org/) is a software engineer turned diversity and inclusion consultant. 

We want CarpentryCon 2018 to be a truly global, diverse and inclusive event, which is why we are so happy that Valerie has accepted our offer to speak there.

Valerie founded [Frame Shift Consulting](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/), which helps technology organizations build in-house expertise and leadership in diversity and inclusion. 

Members of our community may know her as the creator and facilitator of [Ally Skills Workshops](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/ally-skills-workshop),
which teach simple, everyday ways for people who have more power and influence to support people with less. Valerie has taught thousands of people these skills.

In addition to keynoting, Valerie has offered to teach an Ally Skills Workshop at CarpentryCon. I am sure many of our community will scramble to attend that.

She was a co-founder of the [Ada Initiative](http://adainitiative.org/), which, between 2011 and 2015, supported women in open technology and culture by producing codes of conduct and anti-harassment policies, advocating for gender diversity and teaching ally skills.

Valerie also helped establish [Double Union](https://doubleunion.org/) a non-profit which supports women and non-binary people in technology and the arts. 

She previously worked for more than 10 years as a Linux kernel and file systems developer at Red Hat, IBM, Intel, and other technology companies.
