## Hotel Accommodation for CarpentryCon 2018

We have two hotel options for you for [CarpentryCon 2018](http://www.carpentrycon.org/). Both hotels are offering us a special CarpentryCon rate. 

The special rates will be valid for the period of the event and available until the cut-off date; anyone looking to book after that date will be offered the best available rate at the time. 

So please book before 18 April if you want to lock in the cheaper rate.
