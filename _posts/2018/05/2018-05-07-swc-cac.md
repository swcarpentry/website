We now have a group of Curriculum Advisors for the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons) lesson stack. 
[Curriculum Advisors](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/lesson_development_roles.html#curriculum-advisory-committee) help 
to provide strategic oversight, vision, and leadership for a particular set of lessons to guide their overall development. Curriculum 
Advisors meet twice yearly and advise the Maintainers in overall strategies for the lessons. 

Please join us in welcoming Jonah Duckles (@jduckles), Marianna Foos (@MariannaFoos), 
Brittany Lasseigne (@bnlasse), Madicken Munk (@munkium), Byron J. Smith (@ByronJSmith), and David Yakobovitch (@davidyako) as 
the Curriculum Advisory Committee for Software Carpentry lessons.
