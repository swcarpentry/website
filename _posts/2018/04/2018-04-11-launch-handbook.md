<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>

As The Carpentries, we're excited to announce that we have consolidated and updated many
materials and resources to more easily share them online and be a community resource.

Today we are launching an all-new **The Carpentries Handbook**. We will also be tweeting regularly through a
new [Carpentries Twitter account](https://twitter.com/thecarpentries).

### The Carpentries Handbook

We are excited to release our new [Carpentries Handbook](http://docs.carpentries.org/)! Historically, information and resources
have been spread across various websites, Google docs, GitHub repos, and more. We now have a one-stop shop
that consolidates all these resources. In one place, you can now find information on how to run a workshop,
how to develop and maintain lessons, and how to participate in an instructor training event.
You'll also learn about getting the word out about Carpentries activities through our communication channels,
and how to get involved in our global community. Many, many thanks to all the community members who helped develop this site.

We welcome everyone's feedback on this Handbook. Feel free to submit issues or pull
requests on this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carpentries/handbook/).

### The Carpentries Twitter

We also will be regularly tweeting from our new **The Carpentries** [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/thecarpentries) from now on.
Data and Software Carpentry-specific messages will still be tweeted from the individual Twitter accounts, and people will most likely tweet the handles of the
individual Carpentries when teaching workshops. People are welcome to use the [Software Carpentry](https://twitter.com/swcarpentry),
[Data Carpentry](https://twitter.com/datacarpentry), and [The Carpentries](https://twitter.com/thecarpentries) Twitter handles
in whatever combination that suits them.

Please take a look at all our new material and let us know what you think. You can comment
via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thecarpentries),
[Slack](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com), or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/carpentries), but since
issues are less ephemeral than a Tweet, raising an issue or submitting a pull request
to the [Handbook repo](https://github.com/carpentries/handbook) may work best
so we can have a public discussion about what still needs doing.
