We are excited to announce that [Chris Erdmann](https://twitter.com/libcce) has been hired as 
the [Library Carpentry Community and Development Director](http://uc3.cdlib.org/2017/11/06/skills-training-for-librarians-expanding-library-carpentry/) starting May 4, 2018. 

Chris has worked in libraries for more than 21 years to integrate data management and workflows in database and library systems. 
Through training, consulting and tool development to build programs, he has tried to empower people in research and library 
communities to work effectively with data. Chris received his MLIS at the University of Washington iSchool 
while working at the University's Technology Transfer Office, where he helped automate workflows and develop the unit's web presence 
and analytics. He spent roughly ten years working alongside astronomers at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and 
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics to advance library data-mining and linking services, 
e.g. [ESO Telescope Bibliography](https://www.eso.org/sci/libraries/telbib_methodology.html). 
Also during this time, he led an experimental training series 
called [Data Scientist Training for Librarians](http://www.dst4l.info/) (DST4L) geared towards teaching librarians 
data-savvy skills to help transform their library services to meet the needs of their research communities. He recently joined the 
Library Carpentry governance group. 

He is a co-author with Matt Burton, Liz Lyon, and Bonnie Tijerina on the 
recent report *[Shifting to Data Savvy: The Future of Data Science In Libraries](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/33891/)*, 
where Library Carpentry and The Carpentries are highlighted as a necessary next step for libraries to advance their 
research services. 

Chris will be working with the [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.github.io) community and 
The Carpentries to start mapping out the infrastructure for growing the community, formalizing lesson development processes, 
expanding its pool of instructors, and inspiring more instructor trainers to meet the demand for Library Carpentry workshops 
around the globe and thus reach new regions and communities.

This new position is funded by [IMLS](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/re-85-17-0121-17) and hosted 
by the University of California Curation Center (UC3), the digital curation program of 
the [California Digital Library](https://www.cdlib.org/) (CDL). It is intended to support the work 
of the [Library Carpentry governance committee](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/02/library-carpentry-governance.html) 
on streamlining operations with The Carpentries, determining standard curriculum, growing instructor training for librarians 
and planning for community events like the upcoming [Mozilla Sprint](https://www.mozillapulse.org/entry/642) to update
Library Carpentry materials. Chris will be helping to manage the [sprint work](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lc-sprint-2018) in the northern hemisphere.

Chris is excited about advancing the profession and sees the Library Carpentry and The Carpentries communities as the perfect 
catalyst to do that. He is on Twitter as [@libcce](https://twitter.com/libcce), on [GitHub](https://github.com/libcce) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-erdmann-1213a456/), and weâ€™re very excited to welcome Chris to this role!
