Thank you to all the people who have sent in short posts about their favourite tools. We are up to fourteen now, and the variety
of tools is great to see. Finding out what other people use - and possibly more importantly - *why* they use it, and for what, is a great 
shortcut for researchers. There are a bewildering number of research tools around. Getting a tip from someone in your discipline, or from
someone who is doing a similar task to you, can really help.

So why not tell us about yours? All it takes is a few short sentences in a [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiu5NzJsLxYueaQrNn_qKbaa5JR2Sz12CeCRyedKQxwb54Dw/viewform).

So far we have had [Paula Martinez](https://twitter.com/orchid00) on [R](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/my-fave-tool.html),
with [Bianca Peterson](https://twitter.com/BinxiePeterson) [enthusiastically seconding](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/11/bianca-fave.html),
Jeff Oliver sharing his love of [Git and GitHub](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/oliver-fave.html),
[Kellie Ottoboni](https://twitter.com/kellieotto) talking up [IPython](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/ottoboni-fave.html),
and Thomas Arildsen on
how the [Jupyter Notebook](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/arildsen-fave.html) facilitates his teaching.
[Juliane Schneider](https://twitter.com/JulianeS) weighed in on
the [wonders of OpenRefine](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/schneider-fave.html).
Clifton Franklund likes [RStudio](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/11/franklund.html),
while Francesco Montanari is a fan of [emacs](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/11/fm-fave-tool.html).

[Rayna Harris](https://twitter.com/raynamharris)
nominated [videoconferencing](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/11/harris-fave.html)
as her most useful research tool, while [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson) talks
up the [benefits of asking for help](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/11/asking-for-help.html).
Robert Sare has posted on the benefits of [using rasterio](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/sare-favorite/) in
earth sciences research.

Since then, we have had [Richard Vankoningsveld](https://twitter.com/richyvk) 
on [why he uses a coding sandbox](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/12/replit_fave.html), 
and [Auriel Fournier](https://twitter.com/RallidaeRule) telling 
us [how she uses Todoist](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/12/fave-tool-todoist.html) to stay on track. 
QGIS just got [a big tick](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/01/waldman-fave.html) from Simon Waldman.

Expect more posts as people contribute further favourites. Even if your tool has already been mentioned, we would still welcome a post about it,
as your use of the tool may be different.
