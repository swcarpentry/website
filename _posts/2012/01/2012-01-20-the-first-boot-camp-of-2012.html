<p>We just wrapped up the first bootcamp of 2012 at the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu">Space Telescope Science Institute</a>. 14 scientists with a wide variety of computational backgrounds spent two days learning about testing, version control, program structure, the basics of Python, and the psychology of learning and programming. We're following up with 6 weeks of online material, partly because that's what fits everyone's schedules, and partly to see whether a blended approach works better than either strategy on its own.</p>
<p>And on a completely different topic, <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/01/17/every-scientist-versus-journalist-debate-ever-in-one-diagram/">this diagram</a> from the <em>Discover</em> magazine web site sums up every scientist-vs-journalist debate ever:</p>
