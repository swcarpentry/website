<p>We've just added a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/">single-page description</a> of the two-day bootcamps we're planning to run in the next six months. In brief, their aim is to ensure that people have a few core skills, so that they can tackle our online material productively, and to help them get past startup hurdles such as software installation. If you have questions, comments, or suggestions, please add them to that page; if you'd us to help you organize and run a bootcamp, please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">get in touch</a>.</p>
