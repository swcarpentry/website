<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>Based on the feedback we've received so far (both as comments and by email), it looks like we should take development methodologies (i.e., agile development) out of the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/01/revising-the-curriculum.html">core curriculum</a> and replace it with two hours on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nothing: there's already too much in the core.</li>
<li>Spreadsheets: because many scientists use them badly.</li>
<li>NumPy and/or Pandas: because many of them are crunching matrices/doing stats.</li>
<li>Visualization: which in practice would mean the basics of matplotlib.</li>
<li>Image manipulation: because it's fun as well as useful, and lets us talk about binary vs. text data.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am quite arbitrarily limiting options to those five. Please cast your vote (one vote, not three out of five) in comments. We'd be grateful if you could include a brief explanation as well.</p>
