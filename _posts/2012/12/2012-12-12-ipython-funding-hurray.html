<blockquote><p>We are proud to announce that we've received funding from the <a href="http://sloan.org/">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a>
 that will support IPython development for the next two years. Thanks to
 this $1.15M grant, Brian Granger and Fernando Perez will be working 
roughly 3/4 of their time on IPython, Min Ragan-Kelley will be the lead 
project engineer, and Paul Ivanov and Thomas Kluyver will work as 
postdocs on the project. Furthermore, Matthew Brett and JB Poline of 
Nipy fame will be working part-time on the development of notebooks for 
applied statistics in collaboration with Jonathan Taylor from Stanford.</p>
<p>This will also give resources to support two annual all-hands 
development sprints at Berkeley where I hope all our core developers 
will be able to attend, as well as funding for cloud resources so that 
we can provide paid support for our CI hosting and nbviewer beyond what 
the free plans allow (and further services that may arise over time).</p>
<p>We'd like to particularly thank Josh Greenberg, our program director 
at the Sloan Foundation, for the phenomenal guidance and support he 
provided during the grant proposal preparation and detailed review 
process.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we are extremely excited about this news. We'll have
 more announcements to make over the next few weeks, but now I need to 
get a lot of administrative wheels in motion quickly, as the funding 
officially starts Jan 1, 2013!</p>
