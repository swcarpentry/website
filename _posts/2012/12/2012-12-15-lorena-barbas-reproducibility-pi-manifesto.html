<p>Prof. <a href="http://barbagroup.bu.edu/">Lorena Barba</a>, of <a href="http://www.bu.edu">Boston University</a>, presented an excellent <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Reproducibility_PI_Manifesto/104539">manifesto</a> at the ICERM meeting on reproducible research:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I will teach my graduate students about reproducibility.</li>
  <li>All our research code (and writing) is under version control.</li>
  <li>We will always carry out verification and validation.</li>
  <li>For main results in a paper, we will share data, plotting script &amp; figure under CC-BY.</li>
  <li>We will upload the preprint to arXiv at the time of submission of a paper.</li>
  <li>We will release code at the time of submission of a paper.</li>
  <li>We will add a "Reproducibility" declaration at the end of each paper.</li>
  <li>I will keep an up-to-date web presence.</li>
</ol>
<p>So say we all.</p>
