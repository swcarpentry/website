<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>Our existing workshops/material are aimed at people who know enough to write a hundred-line script, but don't yet use version control or do any systematic testing.  Many scientists either haven't gotten this far, or are well past it, and we'd like to start helping them.  We think that means we need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Software Carpentry for Complete Beginners", which would only cover basic programming and version control, and</li>
  <li>"Advanced Software Carpentry", which would cover parallel computing, integration with legacy code written in C/C++ and Fortran, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge, as always, is resources: doing this requires people to put together the content <em>and</em> teach half a dozen times to tune it <em>and</em> help show others how to teach it as well.  It's a big commitment, but the potential rewards are pretty big too.  If you're willing to commit a hundred hours or so to help make the world a better place and give your career a boost, please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">get in touch</a>.</p>
