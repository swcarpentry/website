<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>The W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/wiki/Main_Page">Provenance Working Group</a> recently published a new draft of their <a href="http://www.w3.org/blog/SW/2012/12/12/a-major-release-of-prov/">proposed standard for tracking provenance on the web</a>.  It's pretty dense stuff: even the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-prov-primer-20121211/">primer</a>, which uses the word "intuitive" five times to describe itself, is hard to follow if you've never been immersed in Dublin Core, TURTLE, and the like.  That isn't a criticism&mdash;this stuff is intrinsically hard&mdash;but I think most scientists won't be able to see the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>Which raises a question: if this is the C, where's the Python?  I don't mean, "Where are the libraries?", but rather, if this is the low-level detailed language for describing provenance, where's the 80/20 version that'll do what most people need with much less palaver?  <a href="http://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/">Loren Shure</a> and I talked about this briefly at the recent <a href="http://icerm.brown.edu/tw12-5-rcem">ICERM meeting</a>, and if we can put something together that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>is a strict subset of the W3C proposal,</li>
  <li>works with a variety of files formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, MAT, HDF5, PDF, and PNG), and</li>
  <li>requires people to add no more than a couple of function calls to their code</li>
</ol>
<p>then I think we could actually get people to adopt it.</p>
<p><em>Later: In reply to some early feedback, I think provenance needs to be stored in the files themselves, rather than beside the data, so that it's easier to move from place to place.  I've been wrong before, though... :-)</em></p>
