<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>Software Carpentry wouldn't exist without support from the <a href="http://sloan.org">Sloan Foundation</a>, <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>, and a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/scf/members/">lot of other supporters</a>, but that support won't last forever.  Over the next two years, we need to find a way to make this project self-sustaining; to achieve that, we're currently doing the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use a <em>"host pays expenses" model</em> so that our budget doesn't have to grow as we scale up.<br/><strong>Status</strong>: mostly done.</li>
  <li><em>Make contribution easier</em>, so that people who want to help can do so with little or no overhead.<br/><strong>Status</strong>: we should finish migrating to GitHub by the end of the year, and using IPython Notebooks for teaching will help too, but the world still (desperately) needs a version control-friendly format for general teaching materials.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate <em><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/12/why-be-an-instructor.html">career value to instructors</a></em>, so that people can keep teaching for us even when they're crunched by other commitments.<br/><strong>Status</strong>: we're adding <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/testimonials/">testimonials</a> all the time, and hope to have some bigger stories by the middle of 2013.</li>
  <li><em>Assess our impact</em> in ways scientists will find credible.<br/><strong>Status</strong>: we're currently exploring ways to do this, and would like to hear from anyone who'd like to help.</li>
  <li>Lobby funding agencies and journals to <em>ask hard questions about software</em> (or about software development processes).  In the long term, we need to convert <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/10/twenty-percent.html">twenty percent</a> of scientists to our way of thinking, but we can accelerate that by focusing on the <em>right</em> twenty percent.<br/><strong>Status</strong>: we haven't started this yet.</li>
  <li>Get scientists to <em>include training in budgets and schedules</em>.<br/><strong>Status</strong>: this is the longest shot of all, because it depends on funding agencies being amenable to the idea.  In practice, it may have to wait until we reach our 20% target...</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can think of other things we can do to ensure Software Carpentry's long-term viability, we'd like to <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">hear from you</a>.</p>
