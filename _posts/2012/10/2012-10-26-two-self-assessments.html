<p>A recurring problem with our workshops is the diversity of learners' backgrounds. Below are the results of two pre-workshop self-assessments (on different groups), one phrased in terms of content, the other in terms of specific tasks. The consistency is better than I expected: broadly speaking, it seems that people's impression of how much they know about X is more or less in line with their belief about whether they could do something that requires understanding X. The next step will be to follow up a few weeks after the workshop to see if they actually <em>can</em> do X.</p>
