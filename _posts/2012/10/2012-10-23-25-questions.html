<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>

<p>We've tried several times to define Software Carpentry's aims and content in terms of the questions that researchers ask (see for example our competence matrix and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/09/systematic-curriculum-design.html">this post mapping eight questions to our current content</a>). Our latest attempt is crowd-sourced with a small 'c': the people who are taking part in the first round of our <a href="{{site.training_url}}">online study group</a> for instructors and would-be instructors put together their own lists of questions, along with the answers they'd expect from novice, intermediate, and expert scientific programmers. I've consolidated those lists into 25 questions, which I'd like to boil back down to no more than 10. If you'd like to take a crack at doing that, please post your suggestion as a comment, and I'll send you a Software Carpentry t-shirt if we use it.</p>
