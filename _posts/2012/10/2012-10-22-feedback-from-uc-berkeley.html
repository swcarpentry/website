<p>We just finished up our UC Berkeley bootcamp with <a href="http://penandpants.com">me</a>, <a href="http://katyhuff.github.com/">Katy Huff</a>, and <a href="http://justinkitzes.com/">Justin Kitzes</a> teaching. Here's the feedback:</p>

<tr>
<td>liked the intro/advanced Python split</td>
<td>would like a longer bootcamp with more focus on Python</td>

<tr>
<td>good git introduction</td>
<td>didn't want to learn Python</td>

<p>Unfortunately I missed a pre-workshop memo that most of the attendees would be experienced R users and I could have sped up/skipped some of the introductory programming material in favor of more scientific Python. The second day material on version control and software engineering still seemed to hit home, though, so we didn't totally waste their time. In future workshops I'll try to do a better job getting attendee profiles beforehand.</p>

<p>One piece of feedback I was particularly gratified to hear was someone saying that they thought the IPython Notebook was a good pedagogical tool for exactly the reasons Ethan White and I <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/10/transitioning-to-the-ipython-notebook.html">outlined in a previous post</a>. The student enjoyed focusing simply on the language without the distractions of switching between editors and shells.</p>
