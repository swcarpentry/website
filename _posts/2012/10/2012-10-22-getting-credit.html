<p>A recurring theme in our discussion with scientists is how hard it is to get academic credit for building software, but there are some hopeful signs. As <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~carole/">Carole Goble</a> pointed out to me a couple of weeks ago, <em><a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/">Nucleic Acids Research</a></em>runs two special issues every year: one devoted to <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/W1.toc">web servers</a>, and one to <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/12/04/nar.gkr1196.full">databases</a>. As the introduction to the former makes clear, the journal's definition of "web servers" is pretty broad:</p>
<blockquote>The 2012 Web Server Issue of <em>Nucleic Acids Research</em> is the 10th in a series of annual special issues dedicated to web-based software resources for analysis and visualization of molecular biology data...The present issue reports on 102 web servers.</blockquote>
<p>I'd be very interested to find out what kinds of software skills the contributors to these special issues have...</p>
