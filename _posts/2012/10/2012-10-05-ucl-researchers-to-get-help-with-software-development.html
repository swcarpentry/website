<p><a title="University College London" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a> (UCL) has hired a team leader to start a three-person team for <a title="UCL Research Software Development" href="http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/research-software-development/">Research Software Development</a>. James Hetherington will spend a lot of his time in the next few months talking to those of us working in various areas of research, so we will get to provide some input into the team's activities. However, we do know what they will be offering advice and consultation on software development best practices, including the fundamentals as well as the headline-grabbing HPC work, and hosting version control and issue tracking services.</p>
