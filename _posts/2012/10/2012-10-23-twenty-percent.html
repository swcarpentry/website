<p>I realized a couple of days ago that I'd never blogged about what Software Carpentry needs to accomplish in order to change the practice of science fundamentally and permanently. In a nutshell, we need to convert a fifth of scientists to our way of thinking. Once we do that, the odds are better than 50-50 that every time someone sends a paper out for review, at least one reviewer will ask hard questions about how the computational work was done. I get that number by assuming:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Number of Reviewers</td>
<td>Fraction of Papers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>40%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>40%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>which means the probability that <em>none</em> of a paper's reviewers will ask the right questions is 0.1&times;0.8<sup>2</sup> + 0.4&times;0.8<sup>3</sup> + 0.4&times;0.8<sup>4</sup> + 0.1&times;0.8<sup>5</sup> = 46.5%. It's a grossly simplistic model, but at least it gives us something to shoot for.</p>
