<p>Katy Huff, Justin Kitzes, and I wrapped up our LBL workshop yesterday. We had ~25 participants with a broad range of backgrounds and levels of experience. Here's our traditional table of good/bad feedback:</p>

<p>The good news is that they liked our material and they liked us (and seemed to think we knew what we were talking about). The bad news is a lot of them had a hard time keeping up and a couple complained it was too slow. These are typical complaints of our shotgun approach to teaching to a random sampling of scientists. We'd like to do more discipline specific bootcamps where we can tailor things better. Another typical complaint was they they aren't sure how to apply what they've learned to their research. We're still working on that one.</p>
