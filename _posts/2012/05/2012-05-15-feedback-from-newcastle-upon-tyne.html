title: Feedback from Newcastle upon Tyne

<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>This week's Newcastle bootcamp, organised by the <a href="http://digitalinstitute.ncl.ac.uk/">Digital Institute</a> at Newcastle University with the <a href="http://software.ac.uk">Software Sustainability Institute</a> and <a href="http://soundsoftware.ac.uk">SoundSoftware</a>, was the first Software Carpentry bootcamp run entirely locally in the UK. For the organisers it was a slightly nervous experience, hoping we could get the material to hold together in presentation without Greg's experience at hand.</p>
<p>Feedback from the learners was generally good on the material, the venue and the structure. The most common complaint was that it was hard to follow along at times, and I think there are several areas where we'll be able to improve the "flow" for future events.</p>
<p>Notably, this was the first bootcamp I've attended at which nobody found the room too crowded or the wrong temperature. Result, Newcastle!</p>
<p>Here are the good and bad feedback points. Some points were close duplicates, and I've put the additional ones in brackets (e.g. Python was cited three times).</p>

<li>The "Bringing it together" section</li>
<li>Good mix of content</li>
<li>Version control<br />(+ integration with Bitbucket)<br />(+ version control tips e.g. archive, bisect)<br />(+ use of recipes as version control material)</li>
<li>Coding along with the presenters</li>
<li>Lots of helpers</li>
<li>Good temperature in room, open window</li>
<li>Arrangement of room into groups for collaborative work</li>
<li>Self-guided exercises spaced out through the presentations</li>
<li>Easy to ask the helpers for help</li>
<li>Use of open source software</li>
<li>Test-driven development</li>
<li>Online lecture content to back up teaching</li>
<li>Lots of breaks</li>

<ul>
<li>Felt like we ran out of time at end of first day</li>
<li>Would have liked more about testing</li>
<li>Cygwin</li>
<li>Sometimes problem material got in the way of the subject<br />
<em>(more time worrying about overlapping rectangles than how to<br />
program a test)</em></li>
<li>No handouts, and screens difficult to read as forgotten my glasses</li>
<li>Should have introduced Python lists and other structures earlier<br />
<em>(presenters forgot to do this before using them in an exercise!)</em></li>
<li>Not enough window real-estate</li>
<li>Couldn't always follow material before it disappeared off screen</li>
<li>Presenters sometimes forgot we were not necessarily interested in software engineering</li>
<li>Pace too intense for non-expert programmers</li>
<li>Interrupted by fire alarm</li>
<li>Coloured notes would have worked better in the other order<br />
<em>(that is, holding up "not OK" first &mdash; didn't always dare if everyone else had just held up "OK")</em></li>
<li>More use of microphones</li>
<li>Went a bit fast</li>
<li>Half the class was facing back wall!</li>
<li>Would have liked some harder exercises</li>
<li>More consistency of laptop presentation<br /><i>(i.e. always same laptop with same window layout)</i></li>
<li>Shell scripting section a little easy</li>
<li>Didn't always notice when a presenter had started typing, they should read it out</li>
<li>More pointers to additional material online please</li>
<li>Some exercises had too much literal typing</li>
<li><em>(from a presenter)</em> Would like to have improved the presentation of functions</li>
</ul>
