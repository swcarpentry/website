<p><a href="http://www.runmycode.org">RunMyCode</a> is a web site and service intended to support reproducible research (initially in computational economics). Authors create companion web sites for papers that include the software they used; other people can then re-run their models, and (crucially) play with parameters, using cloud-based instances of those environments. They only support MATLAB, R, and SAS right now, but are hoping to add more tools soon. It's a cool idea, and we'd welcome your impressions.</p>
