<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>We've come to the end of a hot, slightly sweaty, two days of learning in UCL and have just done a straw poll of participants of the good and bad points of this bootcamp. Something that was trialled at UCL was asking participants to sign up in small (3-4 people) teams drawn from their local research group.  In total, we had a little over 40 learners and 10 helpers. We also taught the version control portion using EasyMercurial (thanks to Chris Cannam from SoundSoftware).</p>
<p>Here's what we learned...</p>
<h3>Good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Beginner friendly</li>
<li>Easy learning curve</li>
<li>Now know how to use SQL</li>
<li>Doesn't matter what programming language I used in the first place</li>
<li>Version control for the win</li>
<li>Taught functional programming rather than object-oriented</li>
<li>Material backed up by anecdotes and evidence</li>
<li>Good at giving thoughts rather than skills</li>
<li>Can go back and share with other members of the group</li>
<li>Killed my fear of version control</li>
<li>Give tips on good programming practices</li>
<li>Anything new was given with the why as well as the what</li>
<li>Introduction to systematic testing</li>
<li>Best balance of typing, testing and listening</li>
<li>Good ratio of helpers to students</li>
<li>Greg's digressions keep your mind active</li>
<li>Learned feedback technique of using coloured sticky notes</li>
<li>Test driven development</li>
<li>Quoted Alan Turing (programs are just a type of data)</li>
<li>Working in pairs</li>
<li>Live coding (realtime typing)</li>
<li>Being forced to use python</li>
<li>Psychological aspects, and how it relates to programming</li>
<li>Always good to reinforce the learning of things you've heard before</li>
<li>Interaction with participants at workshops &mdash; both in workshop and in pub</li>
<li>Website is a good resource</li>
<li>Insight (for a sysadmin) of how the researchers I support work</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can't afford to buy all the books referenced</li>
<li>Too early a start [9am start both days in central London]</li>
<li>Too much to take in</li>
<li>Not enough functional programming</li>
<li>Lower level than group is used to</li>
<li>Need coffee at the start of the morning [which we didn't have on day 2]</li>
<li>Problems with the wireless network</li>
<li>Need biscuits in the afternoon</li>
<li>No handouts [though SWC does this because best practice suggests you shouldn't give out handouts at the start]</li>
<li>Lack of air conditioning</li>
<li>Too short (not enough days) [SWC experience shows that 5 days F2F didn't work, will have online followups]</li>
<li>Not clear when you should be furiously catching up on typing</li>
<li>Greg's too fast</li>
<li>Helpers not physically interspersed amongst tutors</li>
<li>Room too small</li>
<li>Not enough desks / table arrangements</li>
<li>Couldn't find nose on list of required software</li>
<li>No documentation on how to get nose running on a windows system</li>
<li>No toilets / running water on the same floor [we broke the toilets and the lift!]</li>
<li>Microphone would have been good</li>
<li>Recommending Cygwin rather than VMware or Virtualbox [but people want to come out with a working setup...]</li>
<li>Implied endorsement of bittorrent for illegal activities (plus smartass comments)</li>
</ul>
<p>What does this tell us? Probably that the teaching environment has a much bigger impact than you might expect, and that we should do all we can to fix it upstream. Also that Greg talks and types too fast!</p>
<p>We're going to have plenty of chances to see how these good and bad points change as we go on to the next workshops &mdash; collecting the evidence so that we can understand how to teach people better.</p>
