<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>With so many people setting up and running Software Carpentry <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/">workshops</a>, I thought it was time to put together a more complete how-to. If I've forgotten anything, please let me know. <em>(Later: please also see this PLoS paper"<a href="http://www.ploscollections.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002245">Ten Simple Rules for Developing a Short Bioinformatics Training Course</a>".)</em></p>
<p><strong>Assumptions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>bootcamp is 2-3 days long</li>
<li>For 20-50 learners...</li>
<li>...who are typically grad students in science and engineering</li>
<li>There is 10:1 ratio of helpers to learners (or better)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Learners leave with a basic set of skills...</li>
<li>...and a big-picture view of how to apply them</li>
<li>A handful of learners/helpers are ready to run workshops on their own</li>
<li>We have feedback on how to improve content/format</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Venue</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prefer flat seating to banked seating (makes it easier for helpers to reach people)</li>
<li>Power, network, and air conditioning
<ul>
<li>40 people plus laptops generate a lot of heat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prefer places where people can drink coffee/eat snacks while they're working</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> make sure venue is accessible to people with disabilities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Weekends, weekdays, and splits have all worked (adjust to local needs)</li>
<li>Start of term works better at universities than end of term</li>
<li>Start of second/subsequent term works better for grad students than start of first term
<ul>
<li>Too many other things going on at the start of a new academic year</li>
<li>By second term, people know whether they need this or not</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mid-term breaks (reading weeks) have <em>not</em> worked well: very high no-show rate</li>
<li>Can also schedule bootcamps right before/right after major conferences
<ul>
<li>Usually means extra accommodation expenses for participants...</li>
<li>...but can be easier to teach when all learners are from the same community</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Times</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We typically run 9:00-4:30, but this will vary to meet local needs</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> remember to take childcare needs into account</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructors and Helpers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recruit instructors <em>before</em>announcing event
<ul>
<li>We're happy to help</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recruit helpers locally
<ul>
<li>Typically grad students who already know this stuff...</li>
<li>...who might be thinking about becoming instructors themselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Remember:</strong>one person can't talk eight hours straight for two or three days
<ul>
<li>Not coherently, anyway</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Registration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your institution/venue may insist you use their system</li>
<li>Otherwise, we use <a href="http://software-carpentry.eventbrite.com/">EventBrite</a></li>
<li>We're happy to host registration (just ask us for access)</li>
<li>Make sure to allow a waiting list</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> usually best <em>not</em>to charge even a nominal amount for registration
<ul>
<li>As soon as any money is changing hands, academic institutions will often charge for space</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advertising</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a page with bootcamp details
<ul>
<li>Usually separate from the registration page (to give more control over content and style)</li>
<li>We're happy to host this...</li>
<li>...or to link to your page if you'd rather host it yourself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tweet and blog about the event</li>
<li>Send mail to departmental mailing lists, disciplinary mailing lists, and specific specific people (e.g., lab directors)</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> remember to include links to the advertising page and the registration page!</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong>notify participants if the event is being broadcast or recorded
<ul>
<li>A signed photo release will be required from each participant if pictures are being taken</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Catering</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Decide whether to provide coffee/snacks at breaks and/or lunch
<ul>
<li>Typically budget $5 per person per snack, $12-15 per person for lunch...</li>
<li>...which adds up quickly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong>remember to take dietary restrictions into account
<ul>
<li>Vegetarian/kosher/halal</li>
<li>Nut/dairy allergies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Week Before</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Request confirmation from participants</li>
<li>Notify people on the wait list if they're going to be able to attend
<ul>
<li>May invite 10 or so people from wait list to show up</li>
<li>If there are still empty seats at mid-morning on the first day, they're welcome to stay</li>
<li>If not, they're welcome to come back for the next one</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> make this clear to wait listed people you invite <em>before</em> they come</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Send software/network setup instructions
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
