<p>The SoundSoftware project &mdash; a UK based project aiming towards software sustainability in the Audio and Music Research community &mdash; is organising a one day workshop on "Software and Data for Audio and Music Research". The aim of this workshop is to discuss issues such as robust software development for audio and music research, reproducible research, management of research data, and open access.</p>
<p>Although the SoundSoftware project is concentrating on the audio and music research community, many of these issues have wider interest, and this workshop could be a way to link with other communities for which proper handling of research software and data are important.</p>
<p>The workshop is taking place at Queen Mary, University of London, on Monday, 18 June 2012.</p>
<p>The registration is <strong>free</strong> and ends on the <strong>31 May 2012</strong>.</p>
