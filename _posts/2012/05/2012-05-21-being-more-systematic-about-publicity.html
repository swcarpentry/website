<p>Several people have suggested that we need to be more systematic about publicizing workshops and other events: blogging and tweeting reaches people who already know about us, but doesn't reach those who don't. If you know of mailing lists and/or news aggregators aimed at researchers who might be interested in what we do, please mail pointers to <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">{{site.contact}}</a>.</p>
