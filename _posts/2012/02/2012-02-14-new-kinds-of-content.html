<p>Mark Guzdial, whose blog on CS education is always interesting, recently posted about <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/using-a-worksheet-to-address-a-cs-education-problem/">using worksheets to help people learn to write programs</a>. As he says, research going back 30 years shows that <em>reading</em> and <em>writing</em> skills develop independently; there's also a ton of research showing that partially-worked examples are a very effective (possibly the most effective) way to teach people new skills.</p>
<p>Which immediately suggests two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Should we provide worksheet-style examples on this site?</li>
<li>If so, would you be willing to help us create them?</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be very easy to say "yes" to the first question: after all, who doesn't want more content? But looking at our site's statistics, it seems that most people are surfers (like <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/01/learners-and-their-needs.html">Xanthe</a>) rather than divers, and people surfing for solutions to specific problems probably wouldn't work through the examples. Also, given my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/02/were-going-to-be-busy.html">travel schedule</a> for the next four months, there won't be any point saying "yes" to #1 unless a few people say "yes" to #2. We can't promise to make you rich, but you'd certainly be popular :-)</p>
<p>We'd also like your help creating another kind of content. I used to teach with slides; these days, like many other people, I just plug in my laptop and program live. It's not just because it's more response&mdash;people also tell me that they learn a lot "by accident" from watching <em>how</em> I program. In that spirit, I'd like to record a bunch of programmers thinking aloud as they solve small problems on their own machines, using their favorite tools [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Emacs on Linux, XCode on Mac, the MATLAB IDE on Windows&mdash;each has its own quirks and joys, and we can all learn something from each of them. Again, the two keys questions are, "Should we?" and "Will you help?" Please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">drop us a line</a> if you'd like to.</p>
