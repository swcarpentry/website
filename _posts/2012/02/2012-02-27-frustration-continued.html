<p>It's been a frustrating couple of days. To recap, I want to convert our material from PowerPoint to HTML5 to make it easier for people to fork and merge, to make things easier to re-style, because it's an open format, and so on. David Seifried has welded an HTML5 audio player to Caleb Troughton's deck.js to create a display tool, which I'm very pleased with, but the content is killing me. Seriously. Here are three slides taken from our first episode on the Unix shell:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{site.filesurl}}/2012/02/shell-filedir-08.png" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{site.filesurl}}/2012/02/shell-filedir-37.png" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{site.filesurl}}/2012/02/shell-filedir-59.png" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>How can I translate those into HTML? The shell session transcripts are straightforward enough&mdash;a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> here, a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> there&mdash;but what about the explanatory comment in blue in the third slide? Or the filesystem diagram in the second? Or the stuff (I can't think of a better term) in the first? As I see it, the options are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give up and do simple bullet-point text with the occasional inset image file, as we did with Version 3. On the upside, it would be easy to write. On the downside, it's second-rate educationally. Good instructors don't cover blackboards with bullet points: they stir diagrams and text together, because that's what's most effective.</li>
<li>Create one SVG (or HTML5 canvas element) per slide. The upside is free-form positioning; the downside is that both are painful to work with, which discourages creativity and collaboration.</li>
</ol>
<p>What I mean by "painful to work with" is that a lot of careful manual editing would be needed to do things like add elements incrementally in sync with a transcript. The result would also be largely unintelligible to search engines, and good luck copying and pasting it.</p>
<p>Back to the drawing board...</p>
