<p>June 4th &mdash; June 15th, 2012<br />
Kellogg Biological Station, MSU<br />
Course sponsor: NIH.</p>
<p>Instructors: Dr. C. Titus Brown, Dr. Ian Dworkin, and Dr. Istvan Albert.</p>
<p>Board of advisors: Dr. Kevin White; Dr. Paul Sternberg; Dr. Rich Lenski; Dr. Robin Buell; Dr. Jim Tiedje; Dr. Lincoln Stein</p>
<p>Applications are being accepted through March 1st (midnight Pacific)!</p>
<p><strong>Course Description</strong></p>
<p>This intensive two week summer course will introduce attendees with a strong biology background to the practice of analyzing short-read sequencing data from Roche 454, Illumina GA2, ABI SOLiD, Pacific Biosciences, and other next-gen platforms. The first week will introduce students to computational thinking and large-scale data analysis on UNIX platforms. The second week will focus on mapping, assembly, and analysis of short-read data for resequencing, ChIP-seq, and RNAseq.</p>
<p>No prior programming experience is required, although familiarity with some programming concepts is helpful, and bravery in the face of the unknown is necessary. 2 years or more of graduate school in a biological science is strongly suggested. Faculty, postdocs, and research staff are more than welcome!</p>
<p>Students will gain practical experience in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python and bash shell scripting</li>
<li>cloud computing/Amazon EC2</li>
<li>basic software installation on UNIX</li>
<li>installing and running maq, bowtie, and velvet</li>
<li>querying mappings and evaluating assemblies</li>
</ul>
