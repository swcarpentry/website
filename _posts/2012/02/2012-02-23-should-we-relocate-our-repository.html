title: Should We Relocate Our Repository?
tags: ["Content", "Software Carpentry"]

<p>Software Carpentry has been an open project since 2004: MIT License for the code, Creative Commons for everything else. All our stuff has lived in a public Subversion repository since then as well&mdash;it's at <a href="http://svn.software-carpentry.org/swc">http://svn.software-carpentry.org/swc</a> if you want to check it out. Today's question is, should we move that repo off our server and onto <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>, or some other repo-hosting service? We want to make it easy for people to remix our content; as I said back in December, that means making it easy for them to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2011/12/fork-merge-and-share.html">fork, merge, and share</a>. Would you be more likely to do this if our slides, learning plans, diagrams, and code samples were on some well-known hosting site rather than in Subversion on our own machine?</p>
