<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>It's time to revise Software Carpentry's three-minute pitch. Here's what I think I need to say; as always, comments would be welcome.</p>
<p>Opening slide: large logo, the title "Computing Skills for Scientists and Engineers", and a small block at the bottom with the date and license.</p>
<p>Our mission is</p>
<ul>
<li>to help scientists and engineers be more productive...</li>
<li>...by teaching them basic computing skills</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is</p>
<ul>
<li>that scientists and engineers spend 40% or more of their time wrestling with software...</li>
<li>...but more than 95% are largely self-taught...</li>
<li>...so they spend hours doing what should take minutes...</li>
<li>...reinvent a <em>lot</em> of wheels...</li>
<li>...and still don't know whether their results are reliable or not</li>
</ul>
<p>Our solution</p>
<ul>
<li>combines short, intensive workshops...</li>
<li>...with self-paced online instruction...</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit is</p>
<ul>
<li>more confidence that computational results are correct</li>
<li>and <em>significant increases in productivity</em>...</li>
<li>...a day a week is common...</li>
<li>...and 10X isn't rare</li>
</ul>
<p>Our workshops cover</p>
<ul>
<li>the core skills a researcher needs to know in order to be productive in a small team:</li>
<li>using version control to manage and share information</li>
<li>basic Python programming</li>
<li>how (and how much) to test programs</li>
<li>working with relational databases</li>
<li>using the shell to do more in less time</li>
<li>Basically, everything you should know <em>before</em> you tackle things with "cloud" or "peta" in their name</li>
</ul>
<p>Our online instruction</p>
<ul>
<li>goes into these topics in more detail...</li>
<li>...and continues with:</li>
<li>program design and construction</li>
<li>matrix programming</li>
<li>using spreadsheets in a disciplined way</li>
<li>data management</li>
<li>development lifecycles</li>
</ul>
<p>Our content is</p>

<p>We also depend on contributions from people like you, who</p>
<ul>
<li>give us feedback...</li>
<li>...create lessons and exercises...</li>
<li>...and organize and deliver workshops</li>
</ul>
