<p>A recent <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2012/02/science-code-should-be-open-source-according-to-editorial.ars">editorial in <em>Nature</em></a>, and a longer article by Darrell Ince, Les Hatton, and John Graham-Cumming titled "<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7386/full/nature10836.html">The case for open computer programs</a>", are just two signs of the growing pressure to raise standards around computational work in science. We can <a href="http://www.scimatic.com/node/361">debate the exact meaning and value of reproducibility</a>, but there's no arguing with the fact that if scientists want to do better work, they'll need better skills. That's the real long-term goal of Software Carpentry.</p>
