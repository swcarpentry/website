<p>Back in February, we asked people to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/02/watch-me-trial-run.html">make short screencasts</a> of themselves solving a simple programming problem. The submissions convinced us that it's a good idea, but so many people ran into so many problems that we're taking a step back and trying to write better instructions, select a simpler (more stable, more reliable) set of tools, etc. Some people's screen recording software stopped recording at 10 minutes without giving any signal; others produced files that play properly on some platforms, but have no audio on others; and screen resolution problems have made text unreadable in several cases.  I didn't think this would be so hard in the early 21st Century, but then, I say that a lot...We'll pick this up again as soon as we can; in the meantime, our thanks (again) to everyone who has contributed so far.</p>
