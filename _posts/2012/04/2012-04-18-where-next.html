<p>Do you know someone who'd be helped by a Software Carpentry bootcamp?  Or can you introduce us to someone who'd help us organize one in a new venue?  If so, please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">introduce us</a>: we'd like to start planning for the fall, and we're always keen to make new friends.</p>
