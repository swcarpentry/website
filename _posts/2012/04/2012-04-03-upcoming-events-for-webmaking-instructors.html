<p>Software Carpentry has had several homes over the years. Right now, it's part of a larger effort by the Mozilla Foundation to teach people&mdash;all kinds of people&mdash;how to make the web their own.  And as part of <em>that</em>, Mozilla is running events over the next couple of months in Boston, San Francisco, Toronto, and London to bring together people who are trying to teach this stuff. The details are on <a href="http://rwxweb.wordpress.com/2012/04/03/upcoming-instructor-events/">Michelle Levesque's blog</a>; we hope you'll be able to join us.</p>
