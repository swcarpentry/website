<p>The first online session for our Indiana University students will run tomorrow afternoon (assuming we can get web conferencing to work&mdash;why is this still so hard in 2012?). Meanwhile, our other workshops are filling up quickly:</p>

<p>and we are now discussing more workshops at other sites: Purdue, Oklahoma, Paris, Melbourne, and possibly ones in South America and Africa as well. If you'd like us to help organize one where you are, please get in touch.</p>
<p><em>Later: that's the good news. The news from other fronts is unfortunately not as upbeat. We're stymied issuing <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/02/badges-finalized.html">badges</a> to people who've completed basic training while we wait for upgrades to the Open Badges site; videos of people solving simple problems have only been trickling in (we have half a dozen, we're aiming for 20-30); and we seem to be chasing our tail with regards to a web-native slideshow tool. I hope the end-of-month status report will be more positive.</em></p>
