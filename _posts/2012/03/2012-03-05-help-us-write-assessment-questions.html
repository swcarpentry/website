title: Help Us Write Assessment Questions
tags: ["Assessment", "Software Carpentry"]

<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>We have been asking people the questions below before the start of a bootcamp in order to get a handle on how much they already know. As part of evaluating the current round of work, we'd like to expand the list a little, and touch on a few more topics.  Our rough categorization of how much someone should know about various things is in the competence matrix; ideally, we want another 3-4 questions on each topic. Our criteria are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The command or concept should make sense on its own.</li>
<li>It should be fairly representative of the topic (that is, not an obscure edge case).</li>
</ul>
<p>Assessing impact may be the most important thing we do in this round of Software Carpentry, so please send us suggestions by email, or add comments to this post.</p>
