<p>Over on rwxweb [1], Michelle Levesque has <a href="http://rwxweb.wordpress.com/2012/03/08/which-web-skills-come-first/">posted and dissected a diagram</a> showing how various webbish skills depend on one another. It's an invaluable design aid, but it violates the third of <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2011/01/24/seven-ways-to-think-like-the-web/">Jon Udell's seven principles</a>: it's presented as a bitmapped image, rather than as something a machine can easily parse and digest. I can't, for example, read the source and generate a two-column table showing "X depends on Y", or something like that. I wrote a bit back in January about <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/01/terminology.html">what sort of data model we could use to represent things like that</a>, but that's the wrong approach as well. What I <em>really</em> want is to discover that someone has already thought this through and created such a model, so that if I want to alter or extend Michelle's model, I can change the authoritative machine-readable representation [2], and she can merge (or at least diff) those changes. All I've found so far, though, are bits of database schema buried in things like Moodle and SCORM; there doesn't seem to be anything that a programmer would recognize as a model or format per se.</p>
<p>Of course, what I <em>really, really</em> want is to figure out how to teach this idea and others like it to scientists and engineers in the 20-odd hours we have for this course...</p>
<p>[1] I hope I've capitalized that correctly.</p>
<p>[2] Of course, I want to make those changes using some sort of GUI rather than editing a blob of XML or JSON or [made-up name of random text format goes here]. If the world was working as it should, I'd be able to use any of several GUIs, depending on how I personally prefer to manipulate models of this kind.</p>
