<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>We're pleased to announce that <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> and Software Carpentry will be continuing and expanding our work to empower scientists with computer science and webmaking skills. We have been working with the <a href="http://www.sloan.org/">Sloan Foundation</a> to teach scientists the concepts, tools and techniques they need to use computers and the web to accelerate their research. In 2013-14, the program will offer an expanded set of workshops, online tutorials, and a new peer-to-peer mentoring program.</p>
<p>In the same way that Mozilla's <a href="https://webmaker.org/">Webmaker</a> program aims to move millions of people from using the web to making the web, Software Carpentry and Mozilla's new Webmaking Science Lab will provide scientists with the tools they need to fully leverage the power of the web in their work. To help advance these goals, Mozilla is now seeking to hire a <a href="http://careers.mozilla.org/en-US/position/oQuSWfwS">Director</a> for our Webmaking Science Lab, and is also offering a rotating three-month paid internship for a graduate student to help organize and run workshops, create new lessons and assess impact.</p>
