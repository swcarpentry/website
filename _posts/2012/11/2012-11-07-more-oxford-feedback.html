<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>Good</strong>
<ul>
        <li>Learned something.</li>
        <li>Mercurial, very useful yet simple. Can apply straight away.</li>
        <li>Practical at end seemed useful way of tieing everything together.</li>
        <li>Doing things in synch with lecturers.</li>
        <li>Scientific approach to programming.</li>
        <li>Whole approach.</li>
        <li>Good overview of the key concepts and foundation to learn more.</li>
        <li>Focussed.</li>
        <li>Course as a whole is good.</li>
        <li>Thorough - basic to advanced - and see new ways to do basics.</li>
        <li>Good practice, can take forward.</li>
        <li>Best practice.</li>
        <li>Really good overview and intro to things not heard of before but would be very useful (version control, MDAnalysis).</li>
        <li>Make and use for things other than C.</li>
        <li>Other instructors chipping in on current instructor was good.</li>
        <li>Loved it, especially version control and make.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td valign="top"><strong>Bad</strong>
<ul>
        <li>Keeping up with the instructors typing on the projectors, so slow the pace.</li>
        <li>Resources and case-studies from the simple examples to complex examples.</li>
        <li>Would like more of a chance to apply what was learned with the instructors around, or at least feedback on a plan.</li>
        <li>Most sessions ran over.</li>
        <li>Problems with later aspects of Python.</li>
        <li>Balance between beginner and advanced - always wasting someones time.</li>
        <li>Knowing simpler Python commands might've helped beforehand.</li>
        <li>Sometimes a bit too fast.</li>
        <li>More time for exercises.</li>
        <li>Target the course a bit more to their area.</li>
        <li>Helps to start with, but good to have more courses and more on each area.</li>
        <li>More time to work on problems and work through case-studies.</li>
        <li>Downloading all the files for every exercise.</li>
        <li>Days away from work.</li>
</ul>
