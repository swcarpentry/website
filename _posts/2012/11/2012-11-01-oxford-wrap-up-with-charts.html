<p>The first Software Carpentry workshop in Oxford has wrapped up, and by all accounts was a big success. Philip Fowler, the host, has posted about <a href="http://philipwfowler.wordpress.com/2012/11/01/running-my-first-software-carpentry-workshop/">running the workshop</a> ("everyone sat up a bit straighter during version control...") and also done <a href="http://philipwfowler.wordpress.com/2012/11/01/feedback/">an analysis of what participants think they learned</a>. In addition, Aron Ahmadia has given us some detailed feedback on how we could improve things the next time 'round. Our thanks to everyone involved&mdash;we're looking forward to a return visit soon.</p>
