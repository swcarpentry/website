<h2><a href="http://software.ac.uk/maintainable-software-practice-workshop">First Workshop on Maintainable Software Practices in e-Science</a></h2>
<p><em>9 October 2012<br />
Co-located with<a href="http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/escience2012/"> 8th IEEE International Conference on eScience</a>, Chicago<br />
</em></p>
<p>This workshop will focus on the issues relating to the development and maintenance of software that can endure past the limited periods of defined project durations and project funding, and go beyond software engineering best practice to address aspects of cultural, organisational and policy change. By bringing together all those with an interest in ensuring the longer term development and use of software for research, including researchers, developers, research computing specialists, software engineers, infrastructure providers, facilitators, and funders, the goal of this workshop is to understand what software practices can be successfully applied and which lead to long-term improvements in the development of software for e-Science.</p>
<p>As part of the workshop we will also be running a panel on the topic of culture change in software management for research, featuring invited speakers from a variety of disciplines who have experienced or instigated these changes, to talk about their real life experiences of scientists of what worked and didn't work for them.</p>
<h4>Topics of Interest</h4>
<p>We invite the submission of work that is related to the topics below. The papers can be either short (4 pages) position/experiences abstracts, or full (8 pages) research papers featuring original, unpublished work.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>software engineering and software product management best practice as applied to e-Science and computational science;</li>
<li>community development, collaborative development, and widening adoption;</li>
<li>licensing, funding, and business models for eScience and research software;</li>
<li>managing governance and organisational change during the software lifecycle;</li>
<li>measuring and analysing the impact of software and software processes;</li>
<li>software attribution, citation, and credit;</li>
<li>interaction between researchers, developers and stakeholders;</li>
<li>transferable software practices from industry.</li>
</ul>
