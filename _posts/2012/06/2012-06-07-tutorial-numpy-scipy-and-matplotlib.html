<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>Today I did a toy data analysis of <a href="https://raw.github.com/gist/2891223/06c4a9709d38625134fa5df0ffa00926c69fd175/temperatures.txt">some annual temperature data</a> in Australia and Canada over the last ~100 years. The goal of the exercise was to demonstrate loading data, inspecting it, and fitting trends. My <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/06/introduction-to-numpy-tutorial.html">last tutorial</a> didn't involve any real data so this week we wanted to change that.</p>
<p>Like my previous tutorial I used the <a href="http://ipython.org">IPython</a> HTML notebook to present. I hadn't been planning to use pylab mode or inline plots but some issues with my matplotlib forced me in that direction. There's an awkward situation here because I actually recommend people not use the pylab interface to matplotlib because the behind-the-scenes magic can cause problems (difficult to debug problems), but for doing demos the inline plots are really the way to go. The obvious upside is that the plots I made as part of the tutorial are embedded in the notebook for you to see now.</p>
<p>The data was stored in a well behaved CSV format so it was simple to load with <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html#numpy.loadtxt">numpy.loadtxt</a>. I used the <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/index.html">matplotlib</a> <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot">plot</a> function for all the figures, even the one where I probably should have used <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.scatter">scatter</a>.</p>
<p>I demonstrated fitting with <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.linregress.html">scipy.stats.linregress</a>, <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html">scipy.optimize.curve_fit</a>, and <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline.html">scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline</a>. The linregress function is useful for doing just a quick linear fit, while curve_fit allows you to fit arbitrary functions to the data since you give it a function you define.</p>
<p>We just scratched the surface of three modules in SciPy today. Skimming <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/">the docs</a> you can see there are a vast array of tools in there. And for a quick look at what matplotlib can do, take a look at the <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/gallery.html">thumbnail gallery</a>.</p>
