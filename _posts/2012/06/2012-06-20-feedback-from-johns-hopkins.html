<p>Today we wrapped up our 2-day bootcamp at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. We had a pretty small group of about 12 each day (out of 20 signed up). In a really pleasant surprise we had students come from Brooklyn, NY and Virginia, plus two students who commuted up from Sigma Space in Lanham, MD. Overall feedback seemed quite positive:</p>

<li>shell went too slow, Python went too fast</li>
<li>projector small/dim (+fonts small)</li>
<li>had to take time off work (about half said they would have come on the weekend.)</li>
<li>would like domain specific Python examples</li>
<li>would like a third day (majority would have come for another day)</li>
<li>hard if you miss the first day</li>
<li>want more NumPy, SciPy, etc.</li>
<li>get left behind if you make a mistake</li>
<li>don't see complexity when writing examples from scratch, could provide some pre-written code</li>
<li>more step-by-step instructions online</li>
<li>wanted to see professional workflow with IPython notebook (from Josh)</li>
<li>could use pre-class surveys to tailor lessons</li>
