    <a href="http://sophieclayton.github.io" class="person">Sophie Clayton</a>
    is an oceanographer at the University of Washington who explores
    the ways in which ocean physics shape plankton communities. She
    received her PhD in Oceanography from the MIT/WHOI Joint Program,
    and wishes that she had taken a Software Carpentry workshop before
    accumulating endless folders of creatively-titled MATLAB scripts.
