<span class="person">Meredith Rawls</span> is an astronomer at the University of Washington. She writes software to prepare for the coming onslaught of data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and studies weird binary stars. She holds degrees in physics and astronomy from Harvey Mudd College, San Diego State University, and New Mexico State University. When she's not science-ing or telling people all about it, she plays viola, volunteers at summer camp, and advocates for more equity and less light pollution.
