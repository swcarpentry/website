    <span class="person">Tom Wright</span>
    is researching the effect of disease on the human eye. He creates
    tools to analyse high resolution imaging and electro-physiological
    signals and integrate the results with demographic and phenotypic
    information scrapped from a variety of sources. His love of the
    command line started with <code>10 PRINT "hello" GOTO 10</code>.
