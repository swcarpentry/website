In particular, she works within the Center of Crop Disease Management (CCDM) where the focus is on the study of a number of fungal plant pathogens. Specifically, Stefania has specialized in genomic assembly, genomic annotation and transcriptomics studies. She believes informatic literacy is a skill set that anyone can benefit from, even working in apparently unrelated fields, and at the same time is definitely undertaught.  </p>
