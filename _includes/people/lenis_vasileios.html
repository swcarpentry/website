His mastersâ€™ dissertation constitutes his first solid work in the field of bioinformatics that led to his PhD research at Aberystwyth University, Wales in the area of comparative genomics and evolution studies. The success of the latter coupled with his initial enthusiasm for teaching led to securing his current position as a bioinformatics training officer in Aberystwyth University, participating to a larger training network across the UK, funded by BBSRC. </p>
