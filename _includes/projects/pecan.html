  The <a href="http://http://pecanproject.github.io/" class="project">Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn)</a> 
  is an integrated ecological bioinformatics toolbox that provides tools to synthesize 
  plant and ecosystem data with mechanistic understanding encoded in ecosystem models. 
  PEcAn is not a model itself, but a platform for model parameterization and calibration 
  that wraps simulation models within a Bayesian framework. The PEcAn Project is an open
  community of scientists, programmers, and educators and we welcome new contributions 
  and applications.
