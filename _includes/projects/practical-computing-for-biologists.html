  <a href="http://practicalcomputing.org/" class="project">Practical Computing for Biologists</a>
  aims to teach scientists of all types essential computational
  skills for data analysis. It assumes no pre-requisites other than
  motivation, features the most useful tools that can benefit
  researchers almost immediately, and explains how to use these
  tools together. With a background level of comfort, researchers
  can then go on to reap even more benefit from Software Carpentry
  and other educational sites and courses.
