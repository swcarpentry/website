  <a href="http://www.mothur.org">mothur</a> is an open source and
  portable software package that meets the bioinformatics needs of
  the microbial ecology research community. It is particularly
  useful for analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequences that have been
  generated using a variety of sequencing platforms. We emphasize
  making the software as easy to use as possible through our efforts
  in maintaining a wiki, blog, and user forum.
