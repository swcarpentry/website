<p>
  Along with the
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/checklists/instructor/">usual duties of an instructor</a>,
  lead instructors are responsible
  for leading discussions among the instructors and host about what to teach
  and who's teaching what.
  They are also responsible for making sure that
  the workshop's web page and repository are set up in good time,
  and for handling evaluation.
</p>

<p>
  All of these duties can be delegated,
  but it's the lead instructor's responsibility to make sure they are done.
  If you've been assigned the lead instructor role
  but aren't comfortable with it,
  or find that you don't have time,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">let Software Carpentry admin know</a>
  as soon as possible.
</p>

<h2>Initial Preparation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Create the
      <a href="{{site.github_url}}/workshop-template">GitHub repository</a>
      that will host the workshop's web pages, following
      <a href="{{site.github_url}}/workshop-template/#creating-a-repository">these instructions</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: if your institution will not allow you to do this,
      please send the information that would have been in the GitHub Pages site
      to the administrators
      so that they can add it to our database manually.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Email the workshop's URL to <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">the administrators</a></strong>
      so that they can add it to our database.
      The workshop will then show up on the main website the next time it is rebuilt
      (which typically happens hourly).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Talk to the workshop host about the workshop audience
      and their desired curriculum and level.
      Talk to the workshop host about the audience;
      what field(s) are they from,
      and what is their expertise level,
      and what curriculum would interest them?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      With the other instructors,
      decide what content to cover,
      what the schedule will be,
      and who will teach what.
      This usually takes a few iterations,
      so don't leave it until the last minute.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Create a schedule for your workshop
      with instructors' names against each topic being taught.
      Be sure to allow enough
      time to set up
      on the first day,
      and for learners to fill in the post-workshop assessment on the last day.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Create the home page for the workshop in that repository,
      and either write or recycle a description of the curriculum
      and setup instructions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Create an Etherpad for the workshop.
      Remind students that they do not need an account to edit the Etherpad.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you're local to the workshop site,
      suggest some helpers if you can.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consult with the host on whether any learners, instructors, or helpers have identified
      accessibility needs that need advance preparation
      (see the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/checklists/accessibility/">accessibility checklist</a>).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make sure that the installation testing scripts included in the workshop website
      have been updated to check only the software that the workshop is actually using.
      (More specifically, edit the list in <code>setup/swc-installation-test-2.py</code>
      so that it doesn't warn people about things they don't need.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consult the
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/checklists/instructor/">instructors' checklist</a>:
      all of those tasks apply to the lead instructor too.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Several Weeks Before</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Send email to potential learners saying that registration is now open.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Create an Etherpad for the workshop by going to <a href="http://pad.software-carpentry.org/">http://pad.software-carpentry.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site</a>
      (where "YYYY-MM-DD-site" is the ID of your workshop).
      You should add this link to the <code>etherpad</code> field in the header of your workshop's home page
      so that it shows up on your workshop's website.
      Note: please don't use our Etherpad for activities other than workshops&mdash;our server
      struggles to keep up with the load sometimes as it is.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>A Week Before</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Send a reminder email to attendees.</strong>
      This should remind them to go through the software installation instructions on the workshop's home page,
      offer to help people who are having problems,
      and ask them to run the installation checking script.
      It should also remind them of the workshop's location
      (and if it is running in two or more rooms,
      tell them which one to go to).
      A <a href="#email">template email message</a> is included in this checklist.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make sure the pre-workshop assessment questionnaire has been created
      and sent to your learners,
      and share the responses with your fellow instructors.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make sure all the instructors have posted their materials
      on the workshop web site.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make sure the workshop helpers are listed on the workshop's web page.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If possible, introduce yourself to the helpers;
      give them the link to the workshop webpage
      and ask them to follow the setup instructions;
      and ask them to arrive at least 15 minutes earlier than learners.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check the link to the Windows installer in your setup instructions.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>First-Day Welcome</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remind everyone of the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make sure all learners are set up correctly and have sticky notes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remind learners of the workshop's goals and schedule.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remind helpers to mingle and encourage conversation
      as well as answer questions and debug setup problems.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      As learners arrive,
      ask them to connect to the network
      and check that they have software installed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Circulate the sign-in sheet and photo release form.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distribute colored sticky notes to learners.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>During the Workshop</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Before each break,
      have learners
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#feedback">submit feedback</a>
      on their sticky notes.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>At the End</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ask for feedback (one good thing and one bad thing)
      and send it to Software Carpentry.
      You can collect it on sticky notes,
      on the Etherpad,
      or in a plain text file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distribute the post-workshop assessment.
      It's best if learners complete it before they leave.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Discuss why assessment is important for Software Carpentry and for participants
      (quantitatively show and measure impact,
      better funding,
      ways workshops can improve for the future).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Let participants know
      they will be asked to volunteer
      for impact study interview in 3 months.
      Very few people have been volunteering
      so their participation is very important.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>After</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take part in a debriefing session.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Fill in the post-workshop questionnaire
      to let the Software Carpentry admin know
      what was actually taught and how it went.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
