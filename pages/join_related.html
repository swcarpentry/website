      Our sibling project Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research.
      Its mission is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research.
      Where Software Carpentry teaches best practices in software development,
      its focus is on the introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research.
      Its lessons are domain specific,
      from life and physical sciences to social science
      and build on the existing knowledge of learners to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research.
      Their target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational experience.
