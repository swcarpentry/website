<p>
  Software Carpentry workshops are community events intended for
  networking and collaboration as well as learning.  We value the
  participation of every member of the scientific community and want
  all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
  Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy
  to other attendees throughout the workshop. The same standards of
  behaviour are expected in Software Carpentry spaces online.
</p>

<p>
  To make clear what is expected, everyone taking part in Software
  Carpentry events and discussions&mdash;instructors, helpers,
  organizers, and learners&mdash;is required to conform to the
  following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code
  throughout events, but you may also contact us directly by email
  at <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">{{site.contact}}</a>.
  All communication will be treated as confidential.
</p>

<p><em><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></em></p>

<p>
  Software Carpentry is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
  experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual
  orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
  nationality, religion, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate
  harassment of participants in any form.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender,
      sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
      race, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
      intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
      recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
      inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All communication should be appropriate for a professional
      audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual
      language and imagery is not appropriate for any event.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist,
      racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
  comply immediately.  People violating these rules may be asked to
  leave the event or be excluded from the online venue
  at the sole discretion of the organizers,
  without a refund of any charge that may have been levied.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
