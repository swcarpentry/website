  Software Carpentry values the participation of every member of the
  scientific community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and
  fulfilling experience.  Accordingly, we strive to ensure equal
  access to all.

<h2>Before the Workshop</h2>
<p>
  Life is easier for everyone if accessibility is considered as part
  of event planning. It's reasonable to ask people to articulate
  their needs, but it's even better if you anticipate those needs
  and ensure they are met. Here are some things to think about:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Are the building and workshop room easily accessible to those
      who cannot use stairs, including transportation to the building?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Are the elevators available at all times?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Are there accesssible restrooms nearby?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If participants will leave for lunch, are there nearby accessible places to eat?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Does the workshop website give a map of the building and room location?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Would there be any problem with having a service animal in the room?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Is the workshop room lighting sufficiently bright to allow lip-reading?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Is the projector screen large enough to be easily read?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the workshop room is large or in a noisy location,
      is a microphone available for the instructors?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Does the sign-up form ask if learners need advance arrangements 
      (e.g. sign-language interpreters, large-print
      handouts, special dietary needs, lactation facilities)?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Have you checked to see if any instructors or helpers need such arrangements?
    </p>
  </li>   
</ul>
<p>
  If learners and/or workshop staff indicate that advance arrangements
  are needed, the host needs to follow-up on this to make sure things
  are ready, and let the instructors and/or helpers know what action
  may be required on their part.  The host institution may have a
  "Disability Services Office" that can help with physical
  arrangements; instructors coming from other institutions might be
  able to make use of their corresponding office for instructional
  planning. Circulating workshop material in advance electronically
  can be helpful to many learners, but may be particularly critical
  for learners who need to adapt it in some way.  Additional ideas are

<h2>During the workshop</h2>
<p>
  Offering help and asking workshop participants what they need is
  preferable to assuming that you know what will work best for
  them. Where possible, it's important to meet those needs in a way
  that preserves independence and dignity. Some suggestions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you're posting directions to the workshop room, include maps
      showing accessible routes. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Designate one helper as being in charge of learners' physical needs. Make
      sure that person knows the locations of the water fountains, (accessible)
      restrooms, elevators, lactation room, and other important places.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make sure that the text projection screen is large and clear enough to
      be read by everyone.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use a microphone if necessary for audibility.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consider having everyone introduce themselves when they speak:
      this is helpful for people with low vision, as well as for everyone
      else whose memory might be already full.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>After the Workshop</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make note of accessibility issues encountered in the
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_report">host report</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
