<h3>Expenses and Fees</h3>

<p>
  Our instructors are volunteers, and so are not paid for their
  teaching, but host sites are <strong>required to cover travel and
  accommodation costs for any instructors visiting from out of town</strong>.
  The Software Carpentry Foundation offers three fee schedules
  for workshops:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Self-Organized Workshops: Optional Donation</h4>
    <p>
      Software Carpentry welcomes you to organize and run your own workshop
      without administrative assistance from the Software Carpentry Foundation
      <strong>by optional donation</strong>. This means you are already connected 
      with our certified instructors and will work with them on all aspects of 
      workshop organization, including curriculum and lesson planning
      as well as logistical details such as student registration.  In order to use the
      Software Carpentry name and logo at your event, we only
      require that you follow our curriculum, have at least one badged instructor teaching and
      co-organizing your event, and <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">let us know</a>
      that you're organizing a workshop. In order to help Software Carpentry
      continue operating and offering workshops around the world,
      we ask for (but <strong>do not require</strong>) a donation,
      and recommend $500 USD as a suitable amount.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Nonprofit Organization: $2500</h4>
    <p>
      If you are a not-for-profit, such as a university or government
      lab, the Software Carpentry Foundation will organize a workshop
      for you (not including instructor travel and accommodation
      costs) for $2500 USD.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>For-Profit Institution: $10000</h4>
    <p>
      If you are a for-profit institution, such as a company,
      the Software Carpentry Foundation will organize a workshop
      for you (not including instructor travel and accommodation
      costs) for $10,000 USD, of which three quarters is used to underwrite
      workshops at institutions that could otherwise not afford
      them.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We strive to be a global project and support diversity in science.
  If you wish to offer a workshop that would further these goals,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact us</a> regarding
  a waiver for the administration fee at the nonprofit and for-profit
  scales. Waivers are not required for self-organized workshops.
