excerpt: Our site's commenting policy is geared towards making our blog a friendly and participatory space
---
<p>
  This version of the site commenting policy was posted in November 2015.
  We will provide an updated link whenever it is updated.
  The text was taken from <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-site-policies.html">Titus Brown's site policy</a>,
  which in turn was derived (with significant modifidations)
  from <a href="http://captainawkward.com/site-policies-and-faqs/">Captain Awkward's</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We are open to suggestions for additions and removals;
  please post them in comments.
  However, this set of policies stands until we change them&mdash;thanks for abiding by them!
</p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>
  The goal of this posting and commenting policy is to help move our
  blog towards being a more participatory and friendly space.
</p>
<p>
  Much of the value we find in writing blog posts comes from the
  responses and feedback we receive on the blog posts, and ensuing
  conversations. This, in turn, depends on people being willing to
  engage in discussions openly, honestly, and in good faith.  The
  policy below is our current best effort towards defining a policy
  that encourages an atmosphere supportive of this behavior.
</p>
<p>
  We have so far only deleted about 15 non-spam comments since
  starting this blog in 2006, so this policy is more to ensure the tone
  than in reaction to any particular misbehavior.
</p>
<h2>Copyright and License</h2>
<p>
  The Software Carpentry Foundation owns the copyright to all of the postings by its staff.
  Guest bloggers retain their own copyright. Quote all of us freely!
  Link &amp; attribute always!
</p>
<p>
  All writings posted on this blog are posted under the
  <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a>
  unless listed otherwise at the top or bottom of the post.

</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>
  By posting your comments to the blog you grant us the right,
  in perpetuity, to use, quote, alter, and/or display those questions
  and comments however we see fit both for commercial and
  non-commercial distribution. If this concerns you, use a pseudonym
  and remove identifying details before you send, or simply post a
  link to your own blog.  Alterations will rarely be made and will
  always be obvious; see
  <a href="http://sarah.thesharps.us/2015/10/05/closing-a-door/#comment-147828">this, for example</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We do not share your personal email address or identity, with one
  exception: people who threaten or harass anyone will
  have their names, emails, and IP addresses shared with their
  internet service providers and, if necessary, law enforcement.
</p>
<h2>Comments Policy</h2>
<p>
  We moderate things in these here parts. Not every point of view
  deserves to be heard. Unmoderated spaces tend to be full of jerks.
</p>
<p>
  Anonymous posting is allowed. Using a consistent identity is encouraged.
</p>
<p>
  Your comments will theoretically show up immediately, though the spam
  filter may eat legitimate comments, even by regular posters.  Alert us
  via e-mail at <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">{{site.contact}}</a>
  if one of your comments doesn't appear.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, sometimes comments don't show up because we delete
  them.  We can delete any comment at any time
  for any reason, and we have no time for rules lawyers. There may not be
  a warning or explanation of why your comment was deleted.
</p>
<p>
  Sarcasm, gentle mocking, criticism, and vehement
  disagreement are generally allowed, as long as the overall spirit is
  constructive and in good faith.
  A non-comprehensive list of some common reasons comments are deleted:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      You're derailing a thread.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The discussion has become uncivil and has devolved into personal
      insults, threats, advocating violence, or turned into a pile-on.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You're otherwise being useless, uninformative, or destructive.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Having your comment deleted or being asked to stop commenting in a
  particular thread or to move on from a topic of discussion is in no
  way an invitation for you to send us lengthy emails detailing your
  thoughts.
</p>

  You can always reach us at <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">{{site.contact}}</a>.
