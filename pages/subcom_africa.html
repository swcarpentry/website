purpose: "<p>The first African Task Force was established in 2016 and consisted of international mentors from the USA, UK, and Australia. This group of mentors volunteered to guide the first batch of trained African instructors through the checkout process as most of them were very isolated and new to the world of the Carpentries. </p><p>Since then more than 100 African instructors have participated in online or in-person instructor training events. The massive growth has enabled us to revive the task force in December 2017, now completely consisting of African instructors. The task force will play a role in mentoring instructors who have been trained but havenâ€™t qualified as well as qualified instructors who need support before teaching a workshop. They will also provide some mentorship to helpers at workshops to ensure they are onboarded. The African Task Force will work closely with the African Workshop Administrators and the Mentoring Subcommittee.</p><p>Some of the South African-based activities are funded through the Rural Campuses Connection Project II (RCCP II). "
