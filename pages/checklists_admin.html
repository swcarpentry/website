<p>
  Admin is the staff at Software Carpentry's (virtual) headquarters
  who support workshop hosts by finding instructors,
  setting up registration
  and assessment,
  and other tasks.
</p>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
<p>
  Before the workshop host has committed to holding a workshop, 
  Software Carpentry admin helps them decide 
  when and where the workshop should be,
  advises on likely cost,
  and provides other guidance.
</p>

<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Find <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_instructors">instructors</a>.
      This should be done <em>before</em> the workshop is publicly announced.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ask the lead instructor to create
      a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#admin_webpage">GitHub web page</a>
      for the workshop and email its URL to <a href="{{site.contact}}">{{site.contact}}</a>.
