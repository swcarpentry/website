A Member Organization is an organization that has made a commitment to the growth and spread of Software & Data Carpentry. Members receive annual access to instructor training and guidance with capacity building at their organization. Members are able to run low-cost local workshops while developing communities of practice around effective data-driven reproducible research. Community developed lessons enable our instructors to globally share the effort for developing impactful lessons on technical topics. Memberships give Software and Data Carpentry revenue to ensure the ongoing development and maintenance of the lessons demanded by research communities. We work to give your local instructors support, mentorship and a forum for community lesson development.

We offer several levels of Membership, based on training activities expected annually.

#### Notes

\* For Coordinated workshops, we will find instructors for the workshop, set up and handle registration, support instructor logistics and coordinate and share assessment results with the member organization. A designated contact approves coordinated workshop requests for that organization. Instructor travel expenses are the responsibility of the member and are not covered in membership fees.

\*\* For Self-organized workshops the organization is responsible for finding local instructors and handling the logistics of the workshop coordination, including registration and registering the workshop with Software and Data Carpentry. As long at least one instructor is certified and the Software or Data Carpentry content is taught, it can be labeled a Carpentry workshop.

\*\*\* Any instructor training includes the instructor mentorship and support of the instructors through the instructor development program.

^ in-person instructor trainings require an available trainer and travel funds to support instructor trainer(s) travel.

We are always interested in new members, and in participating in grants and other proposals. To reach us, or to find out more, [please send us email](mailto:partnerships@software-carpentry.org)
