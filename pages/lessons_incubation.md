[Data Carpentry]({{site.dc_url}}) and [Software Carpentry]({{site.url}})
are committed to developing and supporting lessons in new domains, and
to helping Carpentry community members do so as well. The development
and maintenance of lessons requires significant resources, both up
front and over the long term; this document outlines the requirements
and procedures we have put in place to ensure success and
sustainability.

## 1. How We Determine Which Lessons to Develop

We use the term *lesson* to mean a single teaching module, typically
half a day in length; we use the term *workshop* to refer to an entire
two-day short course, which typically comprises three or four
lessons. The Carpentry community could create and maintain lessons and
workshops on an almost infinite variety of topics. However, in the
absence of infinite resources we must prioritize, and have chosen to
do so according to the following criteria:

1.  We are obligated to develop some workshops by the terms of
    supporting grants and partnership arrangements. Work on these
    necessarily takes precedence over work on other materials.

2.  Our community repeatedly requests lessons on particular subjects,
    which may or may not be the same subjects advocated by our
    instructor community. Because our instructors are usually more
    computationally skilled, and computationally adventurous, than our
    intended audience, we place a higher priority on needs
    demonstrated by communities of learners.

3.  The subject matter is stable and in widespread use (where
    "widespread" means "widely used within a particular domain or
    domains", not just by the author and a few enthusiasts). As
    exciting as new tools may be, they are usually less stable than
    ones which are more established, and their longevity is usually
    less certain.

4.  There is guaranteed support for initial development, delivery, and
    maintenance. (See the next section for more specifics on what we
    require.) This is not only a pragmatic requirement, but also
    confirms interest in the most concrete way.

5.  No equivalent lessons exist—at least, none that do not assume
    prior knowledge, are living documents updated by their community,
    and use a hands-on teaching style.

6.  The lesson materials will be freely available under a license that
    requires no more than attribution, such as the Creative Commons -
    Attribution license (CC-BY). We (strongly) prefer that lessons use
    open source tools, but do not require that. Similarly, we do not
    require that lessons be created from scratch, and in fact prefer
    contributors to recycle materials they have tested in the
    classroom so long as they meet licensing stipulations. We do
    require that lessons use our [templates]({{site.github_io_url}}/lesson-example/)
    and [teaching style]({{site.github_io_url}}/instructor-training/).

Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry’s Steering Committees may make
exceptions to these requirements in special cases, but such exceptions
will be rare.

## 2. What New Lesson Proposals Need

As per point 4 above, proposals for new lessons or workshops must be
backed by concrete statements of support for initial development,
delivery, and maintenance. Such support should include:

1.  One or two lead developer(s) who have made a credible commitment
    to develop and deliver the first complete version of the
    lesson. (Based on our experience with Data Carpentry’s lessons on
    genomics and geospatial data, a new two-day workshop requires 0.5
    person-years of effort.) The actual effort may be less when
    existing material can be recycled, or when the lesson lead has
    significant prior experience with lesson development.

2.  At least two trial sites, where early adopters with both domain
    expertise and experience teaching our general workshops have
    committed to delivering the first complete version of the lesson
    and providing detailed feedback.

3.  Administrative support so that Data and Software Carpentry can
    coordinate work, assess outcomes, and report on results. Based on
    experience with developing Data Carpentry, we budget this at
    US$10,000 for a workshop US$5,000 for a half-day lesson. This cost
    may be incorporated into a partnership agreement with the
    sponsoring organization.

4.  If a full two-day workshop is being developed, the budget must
    also include travel money for a hackathon at which early adopters
    (both those at trial sites and others) can work together to refine
    the first version based on early experience teaching it. This is
    usually a 3-day event for 10–15 people whose costs to participate
    are covered, at which the lead developer(s) will usually teach the
    entire material for early adopters to observe. Based on Data
    Carpentry’s experience, such a hackathon costs roughly US$20,000.

## 3. Roadmap

Our process for new lessons is:

1.  The proposer contacts the Executive Director (ED) of either or
    both Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry by email to determine
    whether someone is already working on a lesson in this area, and
    if not, whether the criteria in Section 1 are satisfied.  The EDs
    may introduce a proposer to others who have expressed an interest
    in the same materials so that they can coordinate efforts.

2.  If one or both EDs express interest, the proposer works with the
    EDs and other members of the Software and/or Data Carpentry
    community to develop and submit a lesson development proposal.
    (See below for a template.)

3.  Data Carpentry and/or Software Carpentry review the proposal. This
    may include soliciting opinions from community members and domain
    experts, or both. The review process is open: all comments will be
    visible to all community members. Community members who wish to
    join the proposal or support it in other ways may do so at this
    point.

4.  If Data and/or Software Carpentry accept the proposal, they
    publish it on their website(s).

5.  The proposers then begin work in an openly-accessible version
    control repository (e.g., GitHub), reporting progress
    monthly. They may adjust goals throughout the development process
    based on feedback from community members; substantial changes in
    goals must be approved by a representative of the appropriate
    Carpentry.

6.  Once the lesson leads have a minimum viable lesson, they deliver
    it, and then provide feedback (both theirs and their learners’) to
    Data and/or Software Carpentry. This feedback must include items
    agreed to in the assessment plan incorporated into the Lesson
    Development Proposal.

7.  The lesson is added to AMY (the web-based tool we use to manage
    the instructor database) so that instructors can indicate their
    ability and willingness to teach it.

8.  After the lesson leads have revised the lesson based on early
    feedback, the Carpentries organize a hackathon to refine the
    material and introduce it to early adopters. This hackathon will
    usually include an on-site delivery of the material.

9.  Early adopters (and the lesson leads) deliver the lesson at
    multiple sites, coalescing feedback and refining the lesson.

10. The lesson leads and Carpentry community members then publish the
    lesson on the Carpentry websites.

11. The lesson leads provide two hour-long online training sessions
    in which they discuss the motivation for the lesson, their
    experience developing it, and what they have learned from early
    deliveries.

12. The Carpentries solicit one or two volunteers to maintain the
    lesson, and the lesson enters the regular maintenance cycle.

Lesson developers are strongly encouraged to add their own
institutions' logos to the lessons. During development, lessons must
use the Data Carpentry or Software Carpentry lesson template, but not
their logos.

## 4. Retirement

If no-one updates or teaches a lesson in a 12-month period, Data and
Software Carpentry may decide to retire it. The community may continue
to maintain a retired lesson, but the lesson will no longer be
included in published releases or discussed during instructor
training.

## 5. Lesson Development Proposal Template

Lesson proposals must include the items listed below.  We expect that
proposals will be developed in conjunction with Software and/or Data
Carpentry, and that at least one of the proposers will have gone
through Software and Data Carpentry instructor training, and be
familiar with our teaching and lesson design methods.

### 1. Short Description

This should be at most 140 characters, e.g., "Tabular Data for
Phylogeneticists" or "Data Management for Digital Humanities".

### 2. Development Lead(s)s

Names and contact information of 1–2 lead developers, along with a
one-paragraph biography for each outlining both their expertise in the
domain and their teaching and curriculum development experience.

### 3. Target Audience

Who this lesson will target, e.g., "Graduate-level researchers in
ecology".

### 4. Lesson Outline

A brief description of what will be taught. Each half day of material
should have:

*   3–6 concrete learning objectives.
*   An end-of-lesson assessment exercise to demonstrate the skills
    participants have learned.
*   A summary of the tools and data set(s) that will be used.
*   A point-form learning plan.
*   A brief comparison with existing open-access lessons on the subject.

### 5. Evidence of Need

Summarize evidence that researchers need this lesson. This summary may
include links to online discussions (mailing lists, twitter, etc) or
publications (e.g., descriptions of practices that are not yet widely
adopted), results of surveys, etc.

### 6. Development Plan

Explain who is going to write and teach what, and when. The
development plan must include a timeline that makes specific people
responsible for specific lesson modules, commitments from specific
sites to teach trial versions of the lesson, a date and location for a
hackathon (if appropriate), etc. We recognize that this plan may
change as lesson development progress, but the more specific it is,
the more credible the proposal will be.

### 7. Support

Explain who will support lesson development and how. If you have
secured funding, attach details. If you have not, but intend to seek
it, describe any planned or submitted funding requests. If the work is
not being funded, explain how development and delivery will be
supported.

## 6. Translations

As inclusive international organizations, we fully endorse instructors
who wish to teach in the languages of their choice.  While we would
like to aid this by supporting translations of lessons into languages
other than English, our experience is that doing this is comparable in
effort to creating a lesson in the first place.  In particular,
maintaining a translated lesson as material evolves requires
significant long-term commitment.  We are therefore only able to aid
such efforts if they are backed by the kind of resources described
above for new lessons.
