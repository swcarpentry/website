<p>
  A workshop host is a person (or group of people)
  who would like to arrange a workshop at their university,
  research lab,
  company,
  conference,
  or other venue.
  Hosts are responsible for finding funding for the workshop, 
  booking a room and catering,
  recruiting local helpers,
  and finding supplies like extension cords and sticky notes.
</p>
<p>
  You may find it useful to look at
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/pitch/">this pitch</a>,
  which explains to faculty, administrators, and others
  what a workshop is and why they should host one.
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
  If you're considering hosting a workshop,
  think about:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where it will be:
      Is a
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_venue">good venue</a> available?
      Will it cost anything to book?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When it will be:
      Lots of factors will affect
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_when">when you can hold your workshop</a>;
      think about what makes sense for you and your audience.
      Be flexible,
      because instructor availability at our end will be a factor too.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      How you will fund it:
      The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_cost">cost of running a workshop</a>
      includes instructors' travel and lodging,
      the cost of booking the room,
      catering,
      and any donation you would like to make to help keep Software Carpentry going.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Who the audience will be:
      Will the workshop be open to
      people in your lab,
      in your department,
      at your university or company,
      attending a conference,
      or anyone nearby?
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_numbers">How many learners</a>
      can you accommodate?
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The answers to those questions will determine:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_who">Who will be permitted to attend</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_charge">What it will cost</a>
      to attend the workshop (if anything).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_followup">What kind of follow-up</a>
      will be offered (if any).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  After you've thought about all that,
  fill out a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/request/">Workshop Request Form</a>
  or <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">email us</a>
  and let us know:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      your location and institution;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      your potential dates;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      the likely audience (research field, previous computing experience); and
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      how many learners you're expecting.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Finalize Details</h2>
<p>
  Together with the Software Carpentry administrator:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Find 
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_instructors">two or three instructors</a>
      per room.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If there is someone at your institution 
      who handles travel arrangements,
      connect instructors with them as soon as possible.
      If not, make sure instructors know how to submit receipts.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Set a date.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Set up registration (if you are handling it yourself)
      or give Software Carpentry admin the
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#eventbrite">information needed</a>
      to set up an Eventbrite registration page.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Local Coordination</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Book a room, keeping in mind 
      the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_venue">ideal room characteristics</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Recruit <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_helpers">helpers</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Discuss the workshop content and audience with instructors.
      (Software Carpentry admin will set up a mailing list for you,
      your instructors,
      and the helpers.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you are restricting registration to a particular audience,
      monitor registration.
      (Software Carpentry admin will give you access to the Eventbrite event.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Book <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_catering">catering</a>
      (if you are supplying coffee and snacks)
      or find out where the nearest coffee shop is.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Obtain or locate <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#equipment">all necessary gear</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/checklists/accessibility/">accessibility checklist</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Confirm that instructors have booked their travel
      and that they know how to submit receipts for reimbursement.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you are using something other than 
      first-come&ndash;first-served registration,
      select the attendees you want to attend and 
      let them know they have a seat.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#publicity">Advertise</a> your workshop.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>A Week Before</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Email workshop registrants and tell them:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    to visit the workshop web page for setup information,
            workshop location,
	    etc.
	    Emphasize the importance of setting up their computers well in advance.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    to let us know if they can't come to the workshop.
            (They can't cancel their own registration on Eventbrite&mdash;they 
            have to email you or Software Carpentry admin.)
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    anything else they need to know about the location, parking, etc.
	  </p>
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If there are cancellations,
      offer those spaces to people on the waiting list.
      (Eventbrite doesn't do this automatically.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If possible,
      plan dinner or drinks with the helpers and instructors 
      the evening before the workshop.
      (Planning to go out for drinks or dinner after the first day 
      is not a terrible idea, either.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Find out where the bathrooms are,
      how to work the air conditioning,
      and who to call if something goes wrong with the facility or network.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make sure security will be expecting you and the doors will be unlocked.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Print out sign-in sheets.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consider organizing a gathering for dinner or drinks
      for the participants and instructors to mingle.
      This is a great opportunity for people to network
      and for participants to give feedback in a casual setting.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Get emergency contact information for instructors and helpers in case of last-minute changes.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Day Before</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Help instructors with travel from the airport to their lodging,
      if necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check that the network is working
      and that any required guest accounts have been set up.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check arrangements with catering (if appropriate).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Morning of the Workshop</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Put up signs directing learners to the room.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Give instructors and helpers ID badges or stickers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Post network connection instructions
      and the Twitter hashtag you're using for the workshop
      (usually #swc<em>something</em>).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consider including a bowl of breathmints for helpers and off-duty instructors to use.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>First-day Welcome</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Introduce the instructors and helpers by name and explain their roles.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>At the End of the Last Day</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Collect the attendance sheet and photo release forms.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remind attendees of any follow-up sessions you have planned.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Send Software Carpentry the contact information of 
      anyone who is interested in joining our team,
      or have them <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact us</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>After the Workshop</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Send the names and email addresses of those who actually
      attended&mdash;not just registered&mdash;to
      Software Carpentry admin.
      An easy way to do this is by sending us the sign-in sheets.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/operations/#host_report">Let us know</a>
      how the workshop went.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Send one last email to attendees to 
      remind them of any follow-up you have planned,
      direct them to other places they can find help,
      and remind them to <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact us</a> 
      if they are interested in joining our team.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Confirm that a contribution 
      to support Software Carpentry development 
      has been sent, or will be.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
