subcomName: African Task Force
purpose: "<p>The first African Task Force was established in 2016 and consisted of international mentors from the USA, UK, and Australia. This group of mentors volunteered to guide the first batch of trained African instructors through the checkout process as most of them were very isolated and new to the world of the Carpentries. </p><p>Since then more than 100 African instructors have participated in online or in-person instructor training events. The massive growth has enabled us to revive the task force in December 2017, now completely consisting of African instructors. The task force will play a role in mentoring instructors who have been trained but haven't qualified as well as qualified instructors who need support before teaching a workshop. They will also provide some mentorship to helpers at workshops to ensure they are onboarded. The African Task Force will work closely with the African Workshop Administrators and the Mentoring Subcommittee.</p><p>Some of the South African-based activities are funded through the Rural Campuses Connection Project II (RCCP II). </p>"
join: "<p>We would love to get more people involved in specific activities to support our growing African community.</p> <p><b>Running online teaching sessions:</b> If you are familiar with any of the lessons and confident with online meeting tools, and would like to host one or more sessions to help build confidence and competence amongst our trained instructors, please email us with more information about the lesson of choice and your availability.</p><p><b>Hosting the monthly African meetup:</b> We would love to hear more voices at our monthly online meetup.
