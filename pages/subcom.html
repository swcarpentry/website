title: Subcommittees and Task Forces
---

<p>
Teaching and organizing workshops isn't the only way to get involved in Software and Data Carpentry; our activities are supported behind-the-scenes by Subcommittees and Task Forces that help solve problems, explore new ideas and provide much-needed service work to the Carpentry community worldwide. Subcommittees and Task Forces are proposed and run by community members like you - check out the links below to see what's already happening and how to get started on something new.
</p>

<h2>Current Subcommittees and Task Forces</h2>

<p>
The existing Subcommittees and Task Forces are always happy to have new people get involved; check out what's going on in these active groups:

<h2>How to Propose a New Subcommittee or Task Force</h2>

<p>
Do you have an idea for an activity or service that would make the Carpentries even more awesome to participate in for its instructors or students? Is there a project, tool or document that would benefit you and your community?
</p>

<p>
We are very excited to hear and support your ideas! However, we do need to read and review all proposals.
</p>

<p>
<strong>To propose a new subcommittee or task force</strong>, please read the <a href='https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/subcommittees/proposal_instructions.md'>information here</a>. The key elements of a proposal that the Steering Committee will be looking for (and which we will help you with!) are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Specificity</strong>: do you have a specific goal, with a plan and timeline to achieve it? Nothing has to be cast in stone at this point, but the more specific your plan, the easier it will be for you to put it into action.</li>
  <li><strong>Resources</strong>: have you anticipated what you’ll need, in terms of personnel, tools, external support and budget? Modest budgets will be available to support Subcommittee and Task Force activities, to be approved on a per-item basis by the Steering Committee; we will be looking for realistic (but non-binding) predictions of what you’ll need to succeed.</li>
  <li><strong>Community Fit</strong>: is there clear vision for how your project will advance Software and/or Data Carpentry’s mission, or enrich our community? The Steering Committee will be coordinating all these groups by making sure we all work together effectively; understanding how your project fits into the bigger picture is an important first step.</li>
</ul>

<p>
More details are in the <a href='https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/subcommittees/proposal_instructions.md'>full instructions</a>; if you have any questions or anything is unclear, don’t hesitate to ask! <strong>The most important step is to let us know your ideas</strong>, so after reading the link above, <a href='https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/issues'>open an issue</a> and let us know what you’re thinking, even if you don’t yet know how to answer all the points above; the Steering Committee will happily help you craft a great proposal.
