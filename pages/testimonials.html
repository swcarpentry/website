  <p>Software Carpentry training has had a tremendous influence on the
    productivity of the students in my lab and several other labs on campus. It
    trained them to write code that works properly more quickly and to automate
    repetitive tasks that they used to spend hours on (now they spend minutes). In
    addition, we are now reusing code much more often, because the code is written
    in such a way that the students can remember what they did and other students
    can understand exactly how the code works. I can't recommend Software
    Carpentry strongly enough.</p>

<blockquote class="testimonial">
  <p>My labmates and I attended a Software Carpentry workshop a few months ago,
    and since then, several graduate students and RAs have been much more willing
    to tackle simple programming tasks independently. We have also now implemented
    a version control repository in the lab: it has greatly reduced the number of
    files flying around and helped to ensure that everyone in the lab has the most
    up-to-date versions of all the code we routinely use. Its history mechanism
    also keeps us from having to manually document every change made or analysis
    done, which has greatly improved our ability to find information quickly.</p>

<blockquote class="testimonial">
  <p>As a nuclear engineer at the US national labs, the number of nuclear safety
    and performance codes I see which are practically untested, basically
    undocumented, and completely lacking in version control is alarming. New
    projects are starting to incorporate better practices, but over and over
    again, students and new staff members show up ready to implement advanced
    numerical methods but don't have a handle on version control. I've found that
    the time it takes to train new researchers to adopt essential software
    practices is vastly reduced by the workshops and online resources provided by
    Software Carpentry. By directing colleagues to the online lectures instead of
    teaching them individually to test and version control their code I've
    personally saved a great number of hours and they've been spared just as many
    false starts.</p>

  <p>As a self-taught programmer, Software Carpentry gave me the tools to plan
    better code before even picking up a keyboard&mdash;improving my ability to
    expand, re-use, and test what I develop. The result is a more reliable, better
    traceable product, and I have a better sense of what to look for when
    evaluating other tools.</p>

<blockquote class="testimonial">
  <p>Armed with a single introductory C++ course, I did a master's degree and
    several years of consulting work on spatial simulation models before taking
    Software Carpentry. Long, slow, frustrating experience left me well prepared
    to appreciate this course. What has changed? I work more quickly, and re-use
    my own code; I find more errors, and spend less time fixing them; I trust my
    results more; I don't mind revisiting and revising old work; collaborators and
    potential employers are more impressed; and I'm happier.</p>

  <p>I started working at the Space Science Lab last November
    focusing on QA for two satellite projects' flight software.
    While I have written and tested lots of software in the past, I
    was unfamiliar with Python which is the preferred language for
    software testing here at the lab.  The workshop gave me the
    tools to start to feel competent in my new job.</p>

    My involvement with Software Carpentry as an workshop instructor 
    and lesson contributor has allowed me to pursue new career paths; most 
    notably, my current position at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  
    As a Software Carpentry instructor, I gained valuable cross-discipline 
    experience: communicating difficult concepts to non-experts, developing 
    skills in computing tools, collaborating with a team, and demonstrating 
    my commitment to better computing skills by volunteering my time.  My 
    involvement with Software Carpentry also introduced me to a unique 
    professional community of people who care about research and computing, 
    which is typically not found in a single university/lab/office.  This 
    community has introduced me to new ideas, tools, and job postings from 
    off the beaten path.

  <p>Software Carpentry helped me to explore the ways in which I improve and
    maintain my code. This made it easier for me to look back upon my old work and
    adapt it for new purposes, thereby making my research progress more
    quickly. It has also let me ask types of questions that I previously had no
    ability to address.</p>

  <p>I depend on the techniques taught in this course to maintain reliable
    programs, scripts and data organization. The time management, revision
    control, debugging and testing strategies are absolutely essential to build
    and maintain my projects. The basic Unix, shell, and scripting skills save me
    significant time and effort every day. It's an invaluable resource for
    computational researchers.</p>

<blockquote class="testimonial">
  <p>While doing Software Carpentry, I made significant changes to the program I
    was using in my research. I felt like I was finally in control of its
    behavior, not vice versa. I still refer Software Carpentry to anyone new to
    programming, best practices, or even Python, especially if I have to work with
    that person.</p>

<blockquote class="testimonial">
  <p>Like most psychology students, I got no formal training in computational
    methods during my undergrad or graduate program. This meant that I was
    effectively cut off from the tool I was using and pessimistic about my chances
    of ever mastering it. Software Carpentry demystified programming for me and
    also gave me a solid background in software development practices. I now use
    tools that I never would have considered before taking the course, and have
    even accepted a postdoc in a computation-heavy lab, which would have been out
    of the question. My only regret is that I wasn't able to take this course
    earlier in my degree!</p>

  <p>Deadline after deadline: research life is as simple as that. As a
    consequence, research software is too often written in a rush. How many of you
    have faced that little, tricky, hidden bug a few days before submission? If
    you did, you also know that feeling of mistrust of your code. Software
    Carpentry showed me how easy and rewarding it is to write code that is
    testable from very early stages: write a little function, and immediately
    check whether simple examples yield the results you expect. And while
    Subversion repositories are not so easy to set up, once they are working, it's
    like having a perfect lab assistant to tell you what is going on at any
    time.</p>

<blockquote class="testimonial">
  <p>Before I attended the Software Carpentry workshop, I honestly didn't think
    I'd pick up anything useful other than a few minor tips and tricks because I
    had been programming for over 6 years at that point. Much to my surprise,
    Software Carpentry transformed the way I approach programming. I learned how
    to write better, flexible software with command-line options; the importance
    of open-source, reusable software in research; and was introduced to the best
    research notebook I've encountered so far: IPython Notebook. I couldn't
    recommend Software Carpentry enough, even for the veteran programmers out
    there.</p>

    I was a physicist in a biology lab, working mostly with
    biologist with little or no knowledge of programming.  What
    Software Carpentry taught completely changed our way of
    working. It was hard to understand at first why seemingly
    simple tasks sometimes took longer, but after a few weeks we
    were able to automate days of work so that we could have a
    coffee break and brainstorm on the actual science. This
    completely changed the way we envisioned studies, from
    limiting ourself to what a student could manually analyze to
    collecting as much data as possible in order to investigate
    modification of mouse Oocytes maturation at timescales we
    wouldn't have looked at.  And even though we didn't have deep
    training in some topics, just knowing that things like regular
    expressions existed allowed the team to consult experts. This
    allowed us to structure the way we did experiments and store
    data in better ways, which in turn made getting new team
    members up to speed much easier.
