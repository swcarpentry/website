websites, download information, or are merely visiting.  Becoming a member of
the SCF will require us to ask for and store additional information.

This privacy policy will govern our use of your information, regardless of what
information we collect.

process a payment and reduce our risk of fraud. We may ask for other
information, but providing such information is completely optional.

their enrollment. However, that information is never made generally available
outside of the Foundation, neither on this website nor anywhere else public.
