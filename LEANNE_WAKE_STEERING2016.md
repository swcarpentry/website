2016 Election: Leanne Wake
===========

## Academic background
 
You can find me in the Department of Geography in the [University of Northumbria at Newcastle, UK](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/w/dr-leanne-mary-wake/).  In 2010 I obtained my PhD in Geophysics from Durham University, UK.  I would describe myself, broadly, as an Earth system modeller. I try to understand the workings of a complex world through the 0s and 1s of code but I have been known get my hands dirty with fieldwork!  

## Relevant experience 

Having been exposed to a wide variety of code instruction techniques (from “you’re on your own, mate” to “Paired Programming”), I became motivated to find out what the right method was to introduce someone to code. I became involved in Software Carpentry (SWC) via a [Fellowship in 2014] (http://software.ac.uk/fellows/leanne-mary-wake) with the Software Sustainability Institute. My main interest is software education - see [here](http://www.software.ac.uk/introduction-fortran-95). I qualified as a [SWC instructor](http://www.software.ac.uk/swc-instructor-training) in 2015 and subsequently co-led a workshop at [St Andrew’s University] (http://lmwake.github.io/2015-06-18-StAndrews/) in the summer of 2015. 

## How I will contribute to the growth of Software Carpentry

* *Global Expansion*:

Involvement with the Software Sustainability Institute and SWC has convinced me that SWC should be made available to as wide a user-base as possible.  As a geographer, I was drawn to this section of the SWC website, and saw that SWC’s [global coverage](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/past/) could be improved. Imagine the scenario: 

**Institute to Funder:** ‘I’d like some money to host a Software Carpentry workshop, please’
**Funder:** ‘What percentage increase in coding ability can we expect from this investment?’
**Institute:** ‘Ummmmm….’

Metrics and Quality Assurance (QA) are a part of everyday life but also huge bugbears for most in academia. However, I believe they can be used as agents for change for SWC.

**As part of my tenure on SWC’s steering committee, I’d like to work with interested parties both inside and outside SWC towards development of a ‘influence metric’ that SWC can use to show the positive impact of it’s teaching.  Let’s turn those post-it notes into points!** 

* *Course Content:*

**Parallelisation:** Making your code more efficient. You have built a car - how do you turn it into a Ferrari?  How many folks do you know have a fancy multi-core machine, yet only use a single core? SWC is contributing towards reproducible science, how about efficient science?

* *Organisational Duties/Miscellaneous:*

I am willing to accept any admin duties to ensure fluidity and expansion of the organisation, e.g.:

-**Maintaining a live instructor database** indicating temporal availability of instructors. 

-**Recruitment:** Workshop and participants number are increasing; Instructor numbers are [tailing off.] (http://software-carpentry.org/about/)

## Anything else we should know?

I own a lightsaber. 

## Finally.....

If you are not sufficiently convinced of my enthusiasm and [nerdiness] (http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2014-10-10-relearning-fortran-through-medium-star-wars) and don’t vote for me, I hope that any members that have taken the time to read this and who find value in these ideas will take them forward.

Thanks,

Leanne
